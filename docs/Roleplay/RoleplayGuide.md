# Guide to Roleplay

Roleplay is another way for players to experience our server and get immersed in the world we have built. Although as a beginner it can seem confusing and hard to understand, so we made this guide to help you learn and become a capable roleplayer! At the end of this you should be able to understand **roleplay terminology**, how to act out **combat roleplay** with dice rolls and **more**! We recommend you read the [how to begin](HowToBegin.md) page first if you're new to roleplay.

## Character Terms

**Roleplayer** - The 'roleplayer' is the person at the keyboard playing the character.

**OOC** - This stands for 'Out of Character'. This refers to anything that is happening out of roleplay, such as something the roleplayer is saying not as a character.

**OC** - This stands for 'Original Character'. Your OC is the character you have created to roleplay as.

**IC** - THis stands for 'In Character'. This refers to anything that is happening in roleplay as characters. It is the opposite of OOC.

**NPC** - This stands for 'Non-Player Character'. NPC's can be made by anyone to provide interesting backgrounds, such as making a random citizen in a village your OC is in. For a character to be an NPC they usually only appear one time and aren't big characters or they aren't actively played by any one roleplayer, meaning anyone can play them.

**Throwaway** - Throwaways are very similar to NPC's but they're a bit more specific. Sometimes another player might need a doctor for one of their roleplays so you could always play a 'throwaway' character who will be there for this situation and then not be played afterwards, some people have recurring throwaways who only appear in situations they're needed in and aren't played elsewhere. It's important to make sure throwaways are realistic to prevent any powergaming or metagaming. (These terms will be explained below.)

## Roleplay Terms

**Powerplaying** - This is a term used to describe a situation where one person's character is controlling another player's character without their permission. This is **not allowed** on our server because we want everyone to be able to shape out their characters lives without other people being able to unwantedly control it.

??? example "Example of Powergaming"
    **'My character threw a rock at your head and killed you'** - This would be powergaming because you just killed someone's character without giving them any chance to do anything, such as dodge the attack and have a chance to survive. Situations which result in some sort of control over another person's character must be agreed by the roleplayers involved.

**Metagaming** - This is a term used when someone has their character know things they never found out in roleplay. This is **not allowed** on our server because it is unrealistic and can easily be used to ruin other peoples storylines and general immersion.

??? example "Example of Metagaming"
    **There's a government meeting and they discuss a new law. I read the meeting out of character and roleplay my character telling people about the new law.** - This would be metagaming as my character wasn't in that meeting so even though I know about it out of character I can't have my roleplay character know this knowledge without actually finding it out in roleplay.

**Godmodding** - This term is used for characters who have unrealistic powers and skills they didn't work for. This is **not allowed** on our server because we don't want characters knowing rare abilities without learning them. You can have a character who is very strong and knows difficult enhanced skills but it's important that they still have flaws and that these skills were all worked for by the roleplayer.

??? example "Example of Godmodding"
    **My character knows combustion bending and how to lightning bend but he has never spent time training for it. He also has a magic compass that tells him when people are trying to hurt him.** - This would be Godmodding because the character knows 2 extremely complex and rare skills which they haven't worked for and also has a highly unrealistic item that gives them an extreme advantage over others.

**Mary Sue** - This is a term for a character who has no flaws at all and is absolutely perfect. This is **not allowed** on our server because we want to keep roleplay realistic and fair so having a character without flaws wouldn't abide by that.

??? example "Example of Mary Sue"
    **My character is the smartest man in the world who also knows bloodbending and mastered waterbending at the age of 5. If anyone makes him slightly threatened they will get killed instantly.** - This would be a 'Mary Sue' character as they have no flaws at all. It's important that characters are kept realistic and aren't perfect by having certain flaws to them.

<center>***If you ever find yourself in a situation where you think someone is doing one of these things make sure to let them know so you guys can discuss it and explain what things might need to be changed to fit these criterias. If you are confused about any of these terms you can always ask other roleplayers.***</center>

## Roleplay Speech

*Please make sure you are using the right channel for roleplaying when doing it in-game or on discord. If you are roleplaying in-game do roleplay in `/ch roleplay` so people know you are roleplaying. If you are roleplaying on discord make sure you carefully select with nation discord you'll be roleplaying in and in which channel you'll speak in to avoid confusion.*

**Speaking in Character** - It's important you make your in character speech obvious so that people don't think you're speaking out of character. We ask you to use roleplay chat channels and it's advised to use speech marks when your character is speaking. For example: `"Hello!" He said as he waved.`

**Performing Actions in Character** - When doing actions as your character it's important to differentiate it from speech to avoid confusion, there are two ways to do this. You can use `*`'s before and after the actions **or** just not use speech marks to show you aren't speaking. For example:<br>
`*I bowed to the King.* "Hello, sir."`   **or**   `I bowed to the king. "Hello, sir."`

**Speaking Out of Character** - When in a roleplay scenario you need to make it clear when you're speaking out of character. You can do this by speaking in local channel rather than the roleplay channel by doing `/ch local`. You can also use brackets around the words you are saying out of character. For example: `I put some dirt in his sandwich. ((This is going to be so funny!`

## Combat Roleplay & Rolls

### General Combat
Combat Roleplay is something people find themselves in a lot. It's a really fun way to have your character get through fights and learn combat without it being unfair. Acting out combat roleplay can be confusing at the start but this should teach you exactly how to do it. It's important you don't break the rules on godmodding and powerplaying as that would completely ruin the fairness of combat roleplay.

This means whenever you are doing combat roleplay and haven't got permission to directly kill or badly hurt someone you leave room for them to react, so instead of going *'I hit and pierce you with a really sharp ice spike.'* you would say *'I lift a sharp ice spike and attempt to hit you in the shoulder with it'* this leaves room for the other person to evade, dodge and react in any way they want, no matter how strong your character is you are never allowed to powergame without the other player's permission. Sometimes this can lead to combat roleplay lasting a very long time if both players are keen on not letting their character get hurt which is why some people prefer to use rolls.

### Rolls
Rolls aren't required when roleplaying so it's important to discuss with the other person if you will be using them or not. Rolls can be done in all our Nation's discords so it's important to ask what command that nation uses for dice rolls. We do rolls out of **20**, so you'll get a random number between 1 and 20 with the lower the number the worse the action is.

If someone rolled a 20 when throwing a boulder and you rolled a 3 for your defence their boulder would hit you as they had a significantly higher roll. Some people don't like to use rolls as they find their combat roleplays are more interesting and realistic when they do it themselves, it's important to note that if you don't use rolls your character should still take a few hits here and there **even if they're a master**.
