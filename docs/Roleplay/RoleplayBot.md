# Roleplay Discord Bot

Currently all our nation discord servers use the **Jinkaku** bot for roleplaying as your characters. Here's a walkthrough on how to use it to set up a character and speak as them! *(You don't have to use this bot when roleplaying on discord,* ***it's completely optional****).*
* * *

## Creating a Character

The bot uses `rp!` as it's prefix for every command. To create a new character you go to the designated 'Bot-Commands' channel and type: `rp!create` followed with **your** character's name.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If I wanted to make a character named 'Roleplay Tutorial' I would type the command, `rp!create Roleplay Tutorial`.

## Character Profile Customisation

Now that you've set-up a character with your desired name it's time for you to begin personalising it! Type `rp!cmds profile` to see a list with all the commands related to character profiles. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on fully personalising your character's profile:

1. Whenever you make edits you need to select the character you want. You can do this by typing `rp!select` and then type the number of your character (the bot will show you which number your character is).

2. Now we can add the information to the profile. *(All the following options are optional and don't have to be added.)*

    - **Age** - To set your character's age you need to type, `rp!age` followed by your character's age.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If my character was 25 I would type, `rp!age 25`.
    - **Gender** - To set your character's gender you need to type, `rp!gender` followed by your character's gender.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If my character was non-binary I would type, `rp!gender Non-Binary`
    - **Sexuality** - To set your character's sexuality you need to type, `rp!sexuality` followed by your character's sexuality.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If my character was undetermined about their sexuality I would type, `rp!sexuality Undetermined`
    - **Description** - To set a character description you need to type, `rp!desc` followed by your character's description.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If I wanted to describe my character as a really evil villain I would type, `rp!desc They are a really evil person who seeks to cause havoc and destruction in their village!`. (Descriptions can be much longer and shorter than this depending on how detailed you chose to do it.)

## Character Set-Up

Once you have added the information you wanted to your character profile you are now able to set-up the finishing features!

- **Avatar** - Adding a character avatar is highly recommended as when you speak as your character it will act as it's profile picture *(See example below)*. To add an avatar, you need to have a picture of your character, you can use our <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewthread/33082915-character-visualization" target="_blank">character visualisation</a> page to help you. Once you have an image, add it as an attachment and type, `rp!avatar`. This will set your character's avatar to the picture you attached.
- **Colour** - You are able to add a strip of colour to your character profile if you want to *(see example below)*. You can do this by typing, `rp!colour` followed with a <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/" target="_blank">hex code</a>.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If I wanted to make a red colour strip I would type, `rp!colour #FF0000`.
- **Prefix** - This is **necessary** if you want to be able to speak as your character on the discord channels. You type your prefix before your message for it to speak as your character.<br><ins>**For example:**</ins> If I wanted to type 'rpR' before all my messages to make it speak as my character I would type, `rp!prefix rpR`. Now if I type `rpR "Hello! Roleplay tutorial here!"` It would speak as my character. See the examples below.

## Example

I followed my tutorial and this is the character profile I created:

     width="600"
     height="300"></p>

So now, when I type `rpR "Hello! Roleplay tutorial here!"` This is what it would look like!

<p align=center><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/765924/modules/forum/attachments/Screenshot+2021-02-20+at+13.58.48_1613829550.png"
     width="600"
     height="300"></p>

Now you can do this with your own information and begin roleplaying as your original character on discord!
