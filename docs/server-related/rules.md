Be careful with trades you make, because not everything will count as scamming if you intentionally knew what was going to happen.

=== "Additional Gameplay Rules"
    <font size=5>Housing & Shops</font><br>

    * You are allowed to have two houses and one shop on your main account. We allow for two houses on a players main account because not everyone can afford multiple accounts. These players use their one account for multiple characters, and may want to have their homes for their other characters.
    * Your alternate account(s) may only have one house and no shops, you can only have one shop per person, not account.
    * You are free to be creative and to decorate the inside of your house and shop however you want (as long as it's appropriate). Changing the style or block of the exterior is not allowed with the exception of minor changes such as window types and placing flowers, pots, or banners. For bigger changes please contact a staff member first.
    * We love to see you display your cards collection proudly on the walls on item frames, but please don't place more than 30 entities (item frames, paintings, armorstands, etc) inside your house or shop as entities on large scale can cause server lag. Estates are allowed to have up to MAX 40 entities.
    * Do not turn homes into shops and shops into homes. You are allowed a shope and a home property, so this should not be an issue.
    * If your properties run out of rent the region will be reverted to its original form. All blocks, chests, and items will disappear. Rokucraft is not responsible for the possible losses of your stuff if your rent expired. We will try to refund your items up to a point, as long as proof can be provided. We may however not be able to refund everything, so be mindful with your rent expire dates.
    * Make sure to check out the 'Gameplay' tab if you need help getting started with a shop or a house!

    <font size=5>Roleplay</font><br>

    * Roleplaying is one of the main aspects of our community. Please be cautious that roleplay does not equal out of character. If you disagree in roleplay that does not mean to fight about it out of character. We can all get along and enjoy our time OOC (outside of character).
    * Meta-gaming and powergaming are not allowed.
    * God Modding is not allowed.
    * Mary-Sue/Gary-Sue is not allowed. It is not interesting to make your character an orphan and also have them be a prodigy at the age of 3. Let's get original in our stories. Originality makes for fun roleplay situations.
    * Argueing in Roleplay is allowed, but if you disagree with someone due to something done in Roleplay, don't argue about it.
    * Power-playing is not allowed
    * Please explain when you are Roleplaying or not.
    * If you RP outside of your role or skillset it will be voided. You can not wake up one day being a master bender. You must work for it.
    * Please use Roleplay chat for roleplaying. Keep in mind that Roleplay chat has a radius of 75 blocks!
    * When roleplaying please use proper roleplay etiquette. This means putting “ “ quotations before and after speaking text, and * * asterisks when doing an action or no symbols at all. This way your intentions are clear to others. Example: *Ras turned his head towards the bandit. He equipped his dagger and charged towards the criminal.* “Hey you, stop!”.
    * We highly recommend you create a character introduction. Do not create a character application right away. Character applications are only used when you are trying to make your character have huge roleplay rank goals. This character that receives an accepted application should be your main character.
    * When it comes to role play families, you are only allowed to play one character per family. You may not create more characters to join a family for the intention of having more family members.
    * When you roleplay a character with disabilities and mental health conditions please be respectful about it. You must research these disabilities before you attempt to roleplay a character with them (EX: PTSD, Bipolar personality disorder, DID, ect.) Please refrain from using stereotypes of some disabilities/communities. For example, do not use Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) as a villain because you think this disease is bad.
    * It's important to have a player's consent when Roleplaying.
    * Each nation has their own roleplay-dedicated Discord. You can find an invitation-link under the pinned messages in #roleplay-announcements on Discord. All Rokucraft rules also apply there.
