<font size=4>The best place to start is to visit the player housing area in <code>/info</code>. That will teach you a few of the commands our housing plugin has to offer. One of the most important commands to know when beginning is <code>/arm help</code>.</font>

<font size=4>If you have enough money to pay the rent and have settled on the house you want its time to purchase! Walk up to the housing sign and right click it to buy it. Alternatively, you can do <code>/arm buy</code> when standing in the region you want to buy. You will be able to see the time you have rented your house for, please note that the date is written as <code>DD-MM-YYYY</code>.</font>

<font size=4>Now that you have bought the house you will be able to see it under your 'My Regions (Owned)'. This will tell you how much time you have left to renew your rent and if you click on the region you want you will be able to access more information to do with it.</font>

<font size=4>You might be wondering where you get the blocks to decorate your house and here is the answer. There are a number of block shops throughout our server, one can be found at spawn. Click the Block Shop NPC to open the GUI which allows you to purchase a variety of blocks for varying prices.</font>

<font size=4>Amongst this extra information about your house there will be an option to sell your house. This can also be done through <code>/arm sell</code>. It's important to remember any blocks left in the house will not go into your inventory and will be deleted instead so make sure you store all the blocks you want to keep when thinking about selling your house.</font>
