<font size=4>Go to the Harbor Town School and head up the stairs to meet the Art Teacher.</font>

<font size=4>Once you find the Art Teacher click him to be warped into the Art Class.</font>

<font size=4>In the Art Class there will be options available for you to buy a canvas (middle) to begin. You will also be able to buy an Art Copier (left) to make copies of your final product later on.</font>

<p align=center><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/765924/modules/forum/attachments/Screenshot+2021-01-13+at+19.11.54_1610571601.png"
     width="600"
     height="300"></p>

<font size=4>With your new canvas go place it on one of the easels and right click on it to sit down and begin painting. To get our variety of paints and tools go into your inventory to access them.</font>

     width="600"
     height="300"></p>

<font size=4>Now it's time to begin painting onto the canvas! To paint, click the Canvas with different colours. Right-Click and drag to draw lines and curves. You can also click with a Paint Bucket and a colour in your offhand to fill in an area.</font>

     width="600"
     height="300"></p>

<font size=4>When you are happy with your painting and are finished you have two options to save it. You can use ```/artmap save <title>``` or use the canvas saving tool that will be in your inventory. When saving your painting's name make sure you don't put spaces in it because if it's lost in the future it won't be able to be recovered.</font>

<font size=4>Now that you have made a painting you can make copies of it to sell or place in an item frame. You can make copies by combining your painting with an Art Copier bought at the Art Class.</font>
