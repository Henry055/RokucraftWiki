There are also signs that tell you what commands you can use to put things up for sale, these commands are <code>/sell</code>, which lets you put items up for sale and <code>/bid</code>, which lets you put items up for bidding.</font>

<font size=4>If you are interested in buying something from the auction house instead of selling click on the Auction Clerk and look in the GUI to see what items players are selling and the prices they are being sold at. You can buy these items by clicking on the item you want and then confirming your purchase.</font>
