<font size=4>Once you get a gem it will be uncut. Gems are worth much more money if they are cut, to cut one head to the Crafting Station in the mine shop. You need to have a certain crafter level to cut more expensive gems, you can earn crafter levels by cutting gems. See your levels by doing <code>/jobs stats</code>.

<font size=4>Once you get some ore you'll need to smelt it to make it worth something. Go to the Smelting Station with your ores and some coal to turn your ores into ingots. You need to have a specific miner level to be able to get rare ores and you need a specific smith level to be able to smelt certain ores. This will all be explained in the GUI.</font>
