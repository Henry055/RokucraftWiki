## Water Bending

    As a waterbender you have fairly strong defensive and offensive attacks. You will be able to form shields in different ways as well as harming your opponent from different kinds of water and ice moves.

    Water’s biggest weakness is it’s lack of mobility. Thankfully, this compensates with the pretty good defence that waterbending has to offer.

    If waterbenders are near a water source, they will be able to use all kinds of utility moves. Whether this is an air bubble to keep you from drowning, or to allow you to swim faster than benders from other elements.<br></font>

## Earth Bending

    The key to being an Earthbender is to wait and listen for the right moment to strike. When the moment comes, you must act decisively. On the server, you have a lot of tactical moves. They could trick, trap, or blind your opponent. This can be effective when combined with other moves.

    Earthbending has both a good defence and a good variety of offensive moves. As an earthbender, you are able to catapult yourself in the air, or move yourself around, as long as you are surrounded by earth.

    Although earth has decent mobility, offence and defence, you are often required to stand on earth to be able to perform the move. Earth is also somewhat slow and not very dynamic.<br></font>

## Fire Bending

    Firebending on the server is just like the show, the element is known for it’s intense and powerful attacks. On the server you will have the biggest choice of offensive moves that are meant to harm your opponent. You will have the most variety in attacks as a Firebender. But watch out! Firebending can also be harmful to you, if you are not careful enough.

    Fire’s biggest weakness is it’s lack of defensive moves.

    As a firebender, you are able to propel yourself in the air, or just on the ground. You will have a few moves that are meant for mobility for in or or outside of combat.<br></font>

## Air Bending

    Airbending is known for it’s dynamic and wide variation of mobility. On the server, you will find a lot of moves that involve mobility. This extends from just jumping super high up, to the famous Airscooter, a move invented by Avatar Aang himself.

    The effectiveness of an Airbender’s defence relies on mobility. An Airbender will mostly use their mobility to avoid incoming attacks from opponents.

    For an Airbender, you will have less choice when it comes to offensive moves. Harmful moves will be limited, but still fair enough to defeat an opponent.<br></font>
