# The Heagga of Nauruk
* * *

## Basic Information

The Heagga clan is rooted in the old capital, also known as Nauruk. They are the most spiritual out of all clans and have the most Shamans and healers. They used to be the Capital of the Southern water tribe but that has not been the case anymore for many years. Due to them being the closest to the closed spirit portal makes their environment the most suitable to grow herbs and flora in the tribe.

### Social Norms
Nauruk/Heagga clan is rather conservative and traditional. But unlike most, if not all clans the females are higher up. They are the head of the house holds where as men live under. Outside the houses men usually live freely and do more for fun than work unlike the women do. When a woman and man marry they move into the females family home and carry the females name. And not the males.

### Reindeer Herding

Heagga clan people often herd reindeer when able to, they used to have a low population. But recently it has began to grow again.

### Attire
Unlike the other clan’s furs and mostly blue attire, the Heagga clan looks very different. Due to their spirituality and heavy belief in spirits, they have slowly developed their own very distinctive style. They call their ceremonial robes and clothing Gakti. They have red threads and patterns sewn into them and often have gold accessories. The shapes vary between people. Married and single people have different patterns, shamans and others have different patterns, chieftains have different patterns and the list goes on.

The colours in gakti are blue, yellow, red, brown and green usually. People of Heagga do not wear makeup or warpaint, other than the 14-year-old boy’s paint after they have passed their rite for manhood. Just like the clothing the hair is important also, being colonized by the Fire nation for many years they have adapted to a few thing they did. You could tell by not only the cloths which rank, or profession the person had. But also how they styled their hair and which accessories they used.

## Rituals

### Duodji
It is a sacred special craft made in ritualistic means to make knives, gakti, beds etc. Men use wood of a sacred tree that is only chopped down for this ritual. Bones and antlers are used as well, the men has to keep raise a Yak reindeer and then offer it to the spirits. Only then they can use these items. Unlike the men, women use leather and roots to make clothing and other tools.

### Yoiking
Yoik is the special ritualistic way of singing in the Heagga clan. It is a hymn-like way of singing. Shamans often yoik while performing rituals. For every ritual there is a different style of Yoik. The people also sing Yoik’s when big feasts are held or just as a every day activity.

### Passing/Birthing

When someone passes away the clan comes together. The shamans chant a Yoik while the Chieftain prepares the body to go from the human world to the Spirits world.

When a baby is born they bring it to the eldershams igloo. They hand him or her over while the Elders perform a ritual. Once they are done blessing the child with their gifts they hand them back to the parents.

### Military

Due to them being the old capital they have a bigger military station than most. But now that they aren’t it has reduced and have now less military men and women. The heagga clan does provide most healers for the army. Even though the military is one, the Heagga warriors wear signs of their tribe to show respect to the spirits.

### Fighting Style

The warriors of Nauruk/Heagga do not believe in taking ones life without reason, they will try to be more on the defensive side rather than offensive. Though when hunting they will try to take the animals life swiftly and painless ending with a thanking ritual.

### Healing

Healers and shamans make out the most population. They have some of the best healers.
