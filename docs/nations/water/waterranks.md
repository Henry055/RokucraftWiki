## Bending Roles

**Master** - These people have completed the roleplay and forum process neccessary to master their waterbending ability. These folks are able to teach and vouch for future masters.

**Healer** - Healers are fortunately becoming more and more common and do not require any application. Healers can range from plant based healing to bending healing.
