# The Yutu of Sukika

The Yutu clan is the clan that resides in the small village of Sukika. Their history has been lost since the eradication of the Waterbenders during the 100 Years War. They lost tradition and relied on others to build the Southern Water Tribe back to its former glory. But now things have changed and thank Tui and La that the elders had kept records of the old way. They are a tribe of fierce hunters who become one with the hunt. They connect to the animal and see themselves as the apex predators but with the knowledge that anything can change during the hunt.

Children are taught at a young age that even with bending or a weapon the hunt is not merciful to all.

The villagers of Sukika and the Yutu work together and when children reach the age of 10 they are able to choose if they want to join the Yutu or not.

Once they choose to join the Yutu, they prepare for the two main tests of the Hunt.

They get to choose their weapon, no matter if they are benders, then they have to learn to make it. First with traditional materials and then in the wild with whatever they have around them. Once they have mastered their weapon, then they pass the first test and they then learn the basics of the others. 

They learn every way to hunt, and even some fighting. But they only know basic self-defense. This is the second test. Learning how to take down each animal, and the best ways to do so. As well as tracking and stealth. The pups will also spar with the newly initiated Nanuk’s.

The pack mentality is taught with intense emphasis because together is the safest and the lone wolf will always be lost. 

They finish the trial at age 16 where they have to venture out into the wild with their pack for a week. Each member must bring home a kill, but what happens on that hunt is forever secret and sealed by blood (the blood oath is done with the Chieftain) to solidify the bond of the pack.

**Medicine:** While there are benders there is an extreme focus on finding ways to heal or patch yourself up in the wild, since there aren’t many healers among the Yutu.

**Greeting:** Hands formed into a claw are placed over the heart in formal settings, in more casual settings it's the clasping of forearms. And for those who are most trusted and loved they clasped forearms to bring the two people close with their arms crossed and foreheads touching.

**Becoming part of the Yutu:** Those born to the Yutu have a choice to join or stay a villager. For outsiders anyone who is able to pass all the tests and has the heart of a hunter can become part of the clan.

**Warpaint:** For ceremonies they use a striped pattern over the face and arms, and some men choose to hunt without a shirt then the lines are moved down their chest with a wolf print in the center of their chest. For simple hunts they have learned to make patterns with paint to help them blend into the wilderness for the hunt. The paint is white to help with the darkness of their skin in the snow.

**Clothing:** Very typical for Water Tribe, used to the extreme cold and tend to wear less coverings than other villages, but nothing too extreme. Mainly sleeveless tunics, or tops with normal trousers and fur lined boots. They also typically are wearing leathers and furs around their waists. The furs are big enough to be able to wrap around their shoulders if needed. Hunters always make something out of their first kill ( example: an arm band out of the skin of a seal or a cloak from a bear pelt.)

### Relationships in the clan
The Yutu have a pack mentality and heavily care about the clan as a whole. Individual packs are like best friend groups, not all the packs get along but they all trust that they will keep each other safe on the hunts. It is thought that the Clan is valued on the strength of their weakest member/pack, meaning that they all must work together to keep the strength of the clan alive.

Marrying a Yutu does not make you a Yutu, you still must pass the tests but you do not not have to become a Yutu to marry one. If you are dating or marrying a non-Yutu you can decide to follow the Yutu traditions or not. 

- **Courting:** When looking to court someone, it is very simple. You just ask them to join you on a simple solo hunt.<br>
- **Engagement:** This is a slightly more complicated tradition: Whoever in the couple decides to ask must do the following. They must go to a the closest relative of the same sex of their partner and ask them to come one a hunt (so if a man is asking then he must take her sister out on the hunt). This is to show that they will be able to take care of them in their ‘new’ family. The relative is able to accept or deny but that is mainly an old tradition. Then whoever is asking must make a weapon and piece of jewelry for their partner, from that hunt. Then if they accept the proposal they will wear the jewelry and they will use the weapon on their hunt for their wedding. (Either gender can ask, it is not expected of any gender to always be the gender to ask. So a woman can ask a man or vice versa.) Same sex relationships are not hated or forbidden in this clan, but they are not common or easily accepted.<br>
- **Wedding tradition:** A wedding is typically a proclamation of the couples love in front of the clan, with the Chieftain or a clan elder (aka Gran). There isn’t a massive spiritual aspect other than a simple blessing. Once this is done, the couple will take the weapon made from the engagement hunt and go alone to hunt. What they hunt will be based on their skill, if they are traditional hunters, they will go for a leopard, but if they are mainly fishermen or smiths they will go for a simple elk. This hunt is thought to be the couples honeymoon, and can last a few days.<br>

### Chieftaincy

To decide a new Chieftain, a mighty and fast creature, typically a wolf or bear, is marked. Whoever succeeds in catching and killing the creature is named the new Chieftain. The creature is picked at the beginning of each Litter of new Pups.
