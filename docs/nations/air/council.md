# Air Council System
* * *

## Overview of the Council System

The Air Collective is divided into 3 locations:

- Southern Air Temple
- Western Air Temple
- Gyantse Village

Each one of them is independent with their own councils.
Those councils are created from one main leader ( Abbot, Abbess, Mayor ) and are accompanied by 2 senior Monks/Nuns.

Elections for abbot/abbess/mayor are being elected through a vote.
The elected ones have their 4 month grace period, after that other opponents can challenge them to an election. 

There is one Air Representative to communicate with other nations on a political stage as well as meet with the temples from time to time. He discusses things with the councils but has no power over them.
