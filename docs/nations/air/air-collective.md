# The Air Collective Lore

The Air Collective is spread around the world and it’s known for its peaceful and nomadic lifestyle. With four temples set in four world directions, the Air Collective has separated themselves high in the mountains that they reach with their gliders.

The Southern and Northern Air Temple was exclusively for males, while the Western and Eastern Air Temple was inhabited by females. That changed after ATRA, when the temples reopened and  the nomads moved in again. There is also a small village on the Earth Kingdom territory called Gyantse, created for nomads that look for a less monastic lifestyle.

The Air Collective Temples are run independently by Abbots and Abbesses while Gyantse village has a Mayor, they all work together with the Air Representative to communicate and work with other nations.

## Present

After the Air Collective lead system was restructured in order to make the temples independent, High Monk Yat-Sen decided to step down after years of leading the Nomads, he appointed Ambassador Samten as the new Air Representative, to take care of the Air Collective’s future.

## Government

The Air Collective is led by Abbots, Abbesses and Mayors alongside their advisors. 

After being elected they have their 4 months grace period, after that they can be challenged and reelected.  Their advisors are chosen by them and usually hold higher positions such as high military ranks or spiritual titles.

Although the temples work independently, the Air Collective’s military is spread around the temples, and answers to one person the High Guardian. This also applies to other organisations like the mastery community, where the Headteacher oversees students from all temples.

Abbots, Abbesses and the Mayor, meet with the Air Representative once in a while to discuss various matters in the Air Collective. Exchanging knowledge, opinions and giving suggestions is fundamental in Collective’s politics.

## Culture

The Air Nomads have a very unique and distinct culture. Not even the Hundred Year War was able to erase their heritage. In the past, the Air Collective had a more strict and traditional way of living, but after the war, a new wave of next generation nomads was formed. Those can be usually found in the Gyantse Village but they also travel a lot in search of new experiences and ways of living. 

The traditional culture is still very present in the temples. Ancient robes, chanting across the temple halls as well as monastic food, can be still experienced by everyone visiting. 

### Monasticism

The Air Collective offers life in celibacy and without attachments. Air Nomads are widely known for their way of living. Their welcoming, open-minded nature and high respect towards every living creature, attracted many travellers. Some even stayed to become nomads themselves, in order to live a better and happier life. 

Due to their highly spiritual lifestyle, every born baby was a bender. Monks use airbending in their traditions as a way of exercising their body and mind, not as a weapon to do harm. 

### Gyantse Village

After the war many nomads living among people of the Earth Kingdom, decided to stay and live their life among their friends and family. Their way of living changed, but some traditions passed over from generation to generation stayed. 

Gyantse Village is a place situated in the Earth Kingdom territory, where the Air Nomads live together but in a less monastic style. Some of them eat meat, some of them date, and buy houses.
