## Mastery

Mastery is divided into 4 tiers which cover techniques of varying difficulty using moves from the <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Earthbending#Earthbending_abilities" target="_blank">Avatar Wiki</a>. The system is designed so that players do not always have to be taught by masters in order to advance. This way players can help each other learn without the need for a master to be available at all times.

Outlined below are the moves and number of trainings associated with each tier. Your teacher will have a detailed guide that specifies how many lessons, sparring matches and/or solo trainings each move requires.

### Requirements

- [x] Have an approved [character application](/roleplay/character-applications)
- [x] Train for a minimum of 8 IRL weeks
- [x] Complete 16 roleplays towards your mastery

### Notes

- This process is **entirely in roleplay** and does not affect your on server moves or abilities
- It is possible to create your own moves as well as learn ones that aren’t taught on the normal path to mastery. You can refer to the avatar wiki to gage the level of difficulty of a move and ensure you complete an appropriate amount of trainings.
- It is uncommon but not impossible for very young characters to achieve mastery, however more work may be required.
- If you have any questions please ask the Nation Leader or your master

## Earthbending Roleplay Tips

Earthbending is based on the Hung Gar style of kung fu. If you’re looking for ways to improve your earthbending roleplay you could do some research on it. Learning about the earthbending influences may help you to more accurately describe stances and moves when roleplaying.

You can find more information on the <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Earthbending#Origin" target="_blank">Avatar Wiki</a>
