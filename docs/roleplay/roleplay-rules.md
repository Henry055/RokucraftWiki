# Roleplay Rules

***Our server has rules on roleplaying to make sure that it is done fairly for everyone. If these rules are broken it can result in a situation having to be non-canon or voided.***
* * *

1. **No Metagaming**[^1] - *Your character must learn their information through roleplay and not use knowledge from outside of roleplay.*

2. **No God-Modding** - *Your character can't have op abilities such as bloodbending without working for it through our system.*

3. **No Mary-Sue Characters** - *Your character can't be perfect and have no flaws. To keep characters realistic they should have flaws and not be overly powerful without training.*

4. **No Arguing (OOC)** - *We ask that you don't argue over roleplay out of character, if there's a disagreement over something like someone else god-modding it's important to remain mature and provide reasons and examples instead of arguing. If the disagreement persists contact the relevant nation leader as they are experienced roleplayers who will be able to help. In some situations staff may get involved.*

5. **No Powergaming** - *You aren't allowed to control someone else's character without the player's consent. This includes things like really hurting them or killing them.*

6. **Use the Roleplay chat channel** - *We have a roleplay channel where roleplay should be done to make it clear what you're saying is in roleplay and not cause confusion.*

7. **You must earn roleplay skills**[^2] - *You have to actively earn and perfect your abilities. You can't just give them to yourself or say you were taught them by a master in your backstory.*

8. **Names should try and fit with Avatar lore** - *We ask you to try and have character names fit with our server and Avatar lore. There are some useful <a href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/avatar-last-airbender-names.php" target="_blank">name generators</a> out there to help you!*

9. **Use roleplay speech** - *Make actions and speech clear in your roleplay messages by using things like speech marks.*

10. **Other player's consent is necessary** - *If you are roleplaying something with another player you must make sure that they have agreed to what will happen (eg. killing them) and that they are comfortable with the situation.*

11. **Research before roleplaying mental health conditions and disabilities** - *You're perfectly able to play a character who has some sort of mental health condition (e.g PTSD, paranoia, bipolar personality discord, etc.) but it's important they're well researched beforehand to prevent any negative and harmful sterotypes entering into our community.*

12. **Behaving in nation discords**[^3] - *Each nation has their own discord server for roleplaying and casual chatting. These servers are connected to Rokucraft and you are expected to follow Rokucraft's rules in them. If you don't you will face the same punishments you would get on the main discord.*

[^1]: If you are a new to roleplay or don't understand these terms be sure to check out our [Roleplay Guide](roleplay-guide.md) page to see their definitions and more.
[^2]: Roleplay skills include things like mastery, special bending skills and sub-elements. You **must** go through our process if you want to have and use these things instead of just saying you already know it.
[^3]: You can find each nation's discord through the main [Rokucraft Discord](https://discord.gg/7WNFu3v). They will be pinned in the **Roleplay Announcements** channel.
