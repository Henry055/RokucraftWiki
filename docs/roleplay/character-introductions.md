# Character Introductions (WIP)

Many people wonder what people mean when they talk about character introductions. A character introduction is a page where you explain who your character is for other people in the community to see, these can be super useful for people who want to learn your characters backstory, stengths, traits, etc. without having to go around asking you for every specific detail. You can see other peoples character introductions and make your own in our 'Character Introductions' section on our <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewforum/9027575" target="_blank">forums</a>.
