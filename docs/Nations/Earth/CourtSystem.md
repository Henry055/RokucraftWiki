# Earth Kingdom Court System
* * *

## The Court Procedure

In the Earth Kingdom, the court system is used when a citizen or breaks the laws of the land. All defenders in court are innocent until proven guilty by the evidence. The evidence has to be presented in court by the prosecution/plaintiffs. If the evidence is not sufficient it will be thrown out of court, and if no new evidence surfaces, the case will be dismissed. The Judge will be unbiased and should be certain without a doubt that the defendant is guilty before allowing a punishment. 

There are two types of courts in the Earth Kingdom, there is the Low Court and the High Court. The Low Court will hear mostly all of the cases in the Earth Kingdom, it will deal with everything from rare cases in Superior and Sovereign law. The High Court uses a jury system of randomized citizens of the Earth Kingdom (this is not used in Low Court). A case becomes High Court of the King signs off on it from the Grand Judge.

In rare cases, those who are proven guilty in the High Court may seek redemption. If deemed worthy they will receive a second chance in society, but if deemed unworthy they will be banished or executed from the Kingdom.

## Court Steps 

***The High Court follows these procedures with 3 judges listed above. The Law Court ignores the Jury and does not have one.***

1. The Handler will welcome the presiding Judge of the court, and once the Judge sits down it is proper to bow on one knee until the gavel is slammed on Earth Kingdom Gold. 

2. The Handler will address both parties and recite the case’s title. They will then give a brief synopsis on why the court case is happening and tell the story line. 

3. Each side of the defendant and the prosecution will be allowed to give an opening statement that will be limited to one chat message. Anything more and the Judge will limit their speech in the court. 

4. The Prosecutor/Plaintiff will deliver their argument on the case and aim to hit these guidelines. **Keep this relatively brief not spanning more than 10-15 minutes.**

    - What laws has the Defendant broken?
    - Why are they guilty? What evidence?
    - Are they too strayed to be put back into society?
    - What parameters should be taken for punishment?

5. The Defendant/Defence will deliver their argument on the case and aim to hit these guidelines. **Keep this relatively brief not spanning more than 10-15 minutes.**

    - Are you guilty or not guilty?
    - If innocent, how did you not break the law?
    - If the Defence pleads guilty, what punishment will they recommend?
    - Is there a chance of redemption?<br>

6. If there are Witnesses from either side of the court they will be addressed now (witnesses will be limited to one per party, unless under certain circumstances). If no witnesses move to step 7.

    - Defence/Prosecution will question their own and each other's witness.
    - Whichever side called upon the witness will go first, the other party will follow. (Keep this to max 2 questions per witness from each side).

7. Rebuttal/Closing statements from both sides will be made, and no objections from either side will be allowed. If they choose, they will address the points made in each other's arguments and rebuttal them. These will be kept for four-six chat messages (if more Judges may step in and cut short).

8. **(Skip this procedure if not in High Court, and move to step 9)** If this is the High Court the Jury will now give their opinion after a 5 minute recess. Only one may speak on behalf of all of them, they will say if they believe the defendant is guilty or not guilty. 

9. A brief break will be called by the Handler. In this 5 minute break the Judge will leave the room to come up with a verdict. They will sentance the defendant if they are found guilty. If the guilty is sentenced to death, banishment, or life in prison they may seek redemption **(May only happen as a consequence of the High Court’s decision)**.

## Seeking Redemption

In the chance that a person is found guilty by the High Court it means they are at the very end of the line. They are at the walls, and the angry platypus bears are barking at them, and getting ready to eat. Here they may prove themselves and have a second chance in society. If they prove themselves worthy they will get to live another day in society, and will be given the chance to change their fate. 

Seeking redemption is an endurance test. The guilty will be put under a suspended boulder. This boulder weighs more than 2 tons on a bad day. Depending on your crime you may be given a heavy boulder or a light boulder. Either way, the weight of the boulder will be almost impossible to carry unless you are masterful in your bending. You will be under the rock for 10 minutes. Every minute on the minute we will check how your endurance is going. If the rock squashes on you, well your fate will have been sealed and you will be dead. You will be able to use your bending. If you are a non bender, well, maybe this test isn't the best option. But for the sake of it give it your best shot. 

???+ info "OOC"
    For 10 minutes, every minute on the minute you will roll for your life. If you roll a 13+ you have survived that minute. If you roll below a 13 you will be taking a considerable amount of inches into the ground. Once you have sinked a certain amount of inches, no matter what the rock will fall on you. For example, you may have just rolled a 12, but your next roll is a 20. If your roll again and it is low it may be the end for you depending about how poorly you have rolled before.

## Courtroom Rules

**These rules of the courtroom are very strict and not something that can be reasoned with. If they are not followed members of the audience and of the case may be punished.**

1. Bowing on your knee once the Judge has taken their seat, and only standing when the bang of the gavel slams against the Earth Kingdom Gold. 

2. If you speak out in the audience you will be subjected to malpractice in the courtroom, and will be immediately removed. If such behaviors continue or you make a scene you will be fined or sent to prison. (Goes the same for speaking out of turn if not an objection).

3. Addressing the presiding Judge(s) over your case as Your Justice or Your Justices. 

4. You may only speak when you have raised from your chair. The Judge will address you when it is your turn to present your argument. Do not interrupt the Judge when they are talking in any such scenario.
