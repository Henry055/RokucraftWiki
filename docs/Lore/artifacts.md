<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>

None know who originated the use of the Yin Lu tablets but these tablets were used by sand tribes throughout the Si Wong desert. Due to the need to preserve energy in such harsh environments these tablets are made out of Rhinoceros beetle horn, which is very light and does not add a significant weight to the sand-sailers. The tablet details how to read the stars and traverse the Si Wong Desert and to the Si Wong rock in the middle of the desert, a geographical way point for many tribes. The Si Wong rock is a holy place for many a sandbender, and has many culturally significant buildings carved into it, holding much of the history and traditions of the tribes. Due to their nomadic ways the sandbender tribes had no official writing system, however the tribes used pictograms and rough drawings to convey the information. Since the invention of the compass however the need for these tablets has disappeared and they have thus become a rarity.

**Nation:**
Earth Kingdom<br>
**Origin:**
A desperate thief who lost his hands pleaded for lifeless replacements, fueled with regret.<br>
**special Attributes:**
The prosthetic rock hands refuse to steal and will write out confessions of all crimes that the holder has committed, and proceed to make penance for these crimes every day.<br>

<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>

Ābhu was a thief who lost his hands when he got too greedy and stole from an Earthbending master's temple dedicated to the badgermoles who taught men refined Earthbending; losing his hands in the process. Ābhu was consumed in guilt and could not think of what else he could do, so he went back to the temple to ask for forgiveness and for his hands to be returned to him. He received forgiveness and his hands at a price: he could never steal, must acknowledge his crimes, and must make up for crimes through work. When he attempted to violate these terms while angry at Abhipad he realized they were not just promises; but enforced expectations. He learned he could not steal, that his hands would confess to his crimes, and that they would bind him to his work to make up for the crimes. He spent the rest of his life at the temple, serving it. When Ābhu died, he was buried near Lake Laogai with his hands. They would later be discovered and utilized by Dai Li agents beneath the lake as The Grips of Ābhu.

**Nation:**
Earth Kingdom<br>
**Origin:**
The shattered pieces from a gifted mirror to the Earth Queen.<br>
**Special Attributes**
None<br>

<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>
 
A very long time ago the Earth Queen was gifted a metal mirror. At first she did not appreciate the gift. She felt as if why would someone give a queen such a cheap metal mirror. She set it on a table and didn't care to even look at it. A few days later the Earth King came upon the item and thought it was beautiful and would be a great gift for his wife, he did not know that she already knew about the mirror. When he gave it to the Queen she looked at it for a second and gave it back. She asked him why this hideous thing was brought back to her. The King rejected her words and asked if she even cared to look at her reflection. She said no because she believed and ugly gift would make her look ugly. However, to please her husband she took a peek, the moment she saw her reflection she fell in love. The king asked her if she liked it now. She lied and said it was okay but she would hold on to it for a bit. Over time the Queen became obsessed with seeing her reflection in the mirror, she loved it so much that it started to be the only thing she did. She would neglect everything else in her life, including the King. The king became upset with how much time the Queen spent looking at the mirror, that he sneaked into her room and shattered the mirror. This did not end well, the Queen woke up to see her precious mirror smashed and it drove her crazy. The event began to drive the queen insane leading her to kill the king and frame the murder on someone else. She was able to put the mirror back together, but whenever she looked into the mirror she saw something hideous. Everyday she would look again in the mirror but she never saw beauty. This caused her to smash the mirror again and have the pieces taken far far away. However, she was still desperate to see her beauty again. Hundreds of mirrors were then made for the Queen but all she ever saw in them was hideous, the reflection of a hag, she could not stand the sight and it only made her more crazy. Later the queen was found dead, she had taken her own life because she thought that she was no longer beautiful but a hideous monster. The pieces of the original metal mirror were gathered but they were not taken far far away. One of the maids fixed and kept the mirror. The maid passed that mirror down in her family with the story slowly forgotten and the item becoming a family heirloom. Someday the mirror's story may be recovered.

During the third avatar cycle villages and cities started to appear throughout the world. Traveling was something that only the rich got to do. If you were born in a place you would stay there. A young girl named Hyon wanted desperately to see the world, and to learn more about other cultures. One night she obtained her fathers old compass, and she heard that outside of her village walls was a spirit. This spirit was named Wrinkle and he was a spirit that would appear throughout the world, and offer guidance to children. She pleaded with Wrinkle to give a fraction of his divine power to her. Wrinkle obliged, and he put a piece of his energy in the compass. Since then Hyon was the first earth bender to step foot in all of other nations. The compass would consume her in a green glossy glow, and transport her to the place that she desired.

<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>
 
It was a time long before ours at the times as Lion Turtles were swimming all around the globe. At this time the first Benders started building up nations of there own.. the Fire Nation had its own village, the Water Tribes started building there village with snow and ice, the Earth Kingdom made its own Village with an earth wall around it and the Air Nation started there first air temples on the mountains. At the time spirits were living peacefully among the humans and Avatar Wan were about to enter his final battle, Guru Lao who at this time already had a strong connection to the spirits has become a good friend to the spirits. As the Avatar fell in the battle and has made its last breathes the spirits were deeply sad. Deeply sad the spirits were shocked and scared of how easily Raava could been defeated by the humans, so a big part of the spirits went back into the spirit worlds. The spirits Lao made friends with were sad about to lose there friend Guru Lao as well. So all the 108 spirits Guru Lao made friends with slowly started glowing and flying towards him right into his Necklace, at the first he didn't knew what happened but moments later he realized they sacrificed their lives for him. Shortly later he was able to hear there voices and see there projections in front of him. The necklace had the power to project or talk to any of the 108 spirits inside or use there powers to call spirits around him, the spirit world or enter the Spirit World itself by deeply meditating for hours with it. With all that power Guru Lao were even able to sense any form of live around him may it be ants around him, trees growing or simply feeling the air. It is said by the spirits that any non spiritual bender who puts the necklace around himself will be able to see the spirits as the guru did as well. It was said that in each wooden sphere there is one spirit residing inside. As Guru Lao reached a high age he told the other air bender to put the Necklace on his grave as it was the thing he cared about the most after all it had all his friends inside it, so the Gurus, Monk and Nuns agreed on his request and the day he died they put his grave into an hidden room deep inside the mountain where now stands the fully done Southern Air Temple, some say they have seen animals or ghosts walking in and out that sealed door.

**Nation:**
Water Tribes<br>
**Origin:**
Lai Yun, a young waterbender.<br>
**Special Attributes:**
Stores a singular soul and allows for communication during a full moon.<br>

<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>
 
The Vial of the Linghun—or soul—stores a singular spirit. About 300 years ago, a young waterbender, Lai Yun, lived peacefully within the walls of the Northern Water Tribe with her mother, Su Yun, one of the tribe's healers. Lai and Su were inseparable—they did everything together. One day, as Su finished healing one of her patients, she feel deeply ill. No healer was able to help her. Lai was beyond devastated and incredibly desperate to save her mother, so she went to an old mystic that lived at the edge of her settlement. The Mystic, however, was only adept with talking to the dead, not saving the living. She was an elderly woman who said she would communicate with souls. Lai was intrigued with the idea of speaking to souls, but was not pleased that she would have to hear the words of her mother thru a woman that looked older than the world itself. Instead, The Mystic offered another solution, to create a vial for her mother's soul. She gave Lai the instructions for what to do and then Lai quickly ran home and found an empty vial of perfume in her mother's closet. That night, during a full moon—when her bending was at her strongest—Lai did everything that The Mystic had instructed her to do. Within the next few days Su Yun had passed away and Lai cast her soul into the vial. Every full moon, Su's spirit spoke with Lai until Lai herself passed away from old age. Eventually, someone accidentally opened the vial and let Su's soul lose. The vial, however, is still fully capable of hosting yet another soul and only waterbenders have the ability to guide them inside.

**Nation:**
Water Tribes<br>
**Origin:**
Southern Water Tribe, 462 BG<br>
**Special Attributes:**
None<br>

<font size=3>**Brief History**</font>
 
Due to the nature of the Southern Water Tribe and their usage of oral history, little is known of the development of southern waterbending techniques. While stories are most often passed down, only a few can be verified by the few artifacts kept by the tribal elders. One of the most pristine and well-kept artifacts in their collections, however, is the Scrimshaw of Ice-breaker Inuksuk. Carved from the tusk of a walrus yak, this ancient bone carving recites to the tale of Captain Inuksuk, a profound waterbending master who developed a technique of waterbending to use focused precision and sheer force of will to crack vast reaches of ice. These techniques were taught to navigators aboard water vessels to break apart the ice in the path of the boats. Legend says Inuksuk once even using his ice-breaking technique to break open a glacier to create a new freshwater stream for the tribe. In modern southern waterbending, the techniques are still in practice by sailors and ice fishermen.
