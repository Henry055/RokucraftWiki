**Nation:**
Water Tribe<br>
**Notable Events/Actions/Contributions:**
Led the first people from the Northern Water Tribe to the land of the South Pole<br>

<font size=3>**Brief Information:**</font>

Many centuries ago, when the Northern Water Tribe was known as just the Water Tribe, the waterbenders first began to construct larger, more robust ships that would rely on the winds and the tides to propel themselves, moving them away from using the conventional, smaller boats. This allowed them to travel much greater distances, and made their trade with other Nations extremely efficient and profitable. However, it took a lot of skill for a captain of one of these ships to be able to guide and maneuver them productively. One of the most accomplished of these captains was named Narjuk.
Part of what made Narjuk such an effective sailor was his use of the stars to guide his ships course. This method was developed by Narjuk's grandfather, who then passed it on to Narjuk's father and uncles. Their family believed that the stars in the sky were children of the moon spirit, Tui, and they were there to lead the people of the Water Tribe to their future.

**Nation:**
Water Tribe<br>
**Notable Events/Actions/Contributions:**
Gifted the first betrothal necklace<br>

<font size=3>**Brief Information:**</font>

When they first met, Selan and Torin disliked each other. Every time they met they fought. However, after pleading with their parents, they were unable to convince them to break off the engagement. Defeated, the engaged couple met one day to complain to each other about the situation, and Torin, who found a small stone on the ground, mindlessly began to carve an intricate image onto it with another stone. At the end of the night, they were laughing at their predicament, no longer hating each other's company. That same night Torin made a promise that whatever happens in their marriage he would never leave Selan's side, and he attached his stone to the choker necklace that she was wearing. He explained that it was the symbol of his promise.
Many years later, Torin and Selan had a son. When their son was also arranged to marry, Torin told his son to fashion his own necklace to give to his future bride and to give her the same promise Torin gave to Selan. Torin's son told his own children to do the same and other couples began to take on the gesture, until, over several decades, it became a tradition in both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes.

## <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewthread/32838474-historical-figure-joquo-assassin-east" target="_blank">Joquo the Assassin of the East</a>

**Nation:**
Earth Kingdom<br>
**Notable Events/Actions/Contributions:**

- Assassin from the Earth Kingdom, he worked like he wielded the strength of 100 men and women.<br>
- He assassinated many political figures in the Earth Kingdom including Governors, Mayors, Tyrants, and even the Earth King.<br>
- He killed in the name of freedom and justice for the people. Though, many looked at him as a ruthless killing machine that took lives with no hesitation.<br>

<font size=3>**Brief Information:**</font>

Joquo created fear in the Earth Kingdom, the type of fear to scare criminals and tyrants. He created a everlasting feel that someone was always watching you. If you took one step out of line, one step in the wrong direction it would be your last. Since then government officials, especially Governors and Mayors stayed in line. They didn't want to face the wrath of the man who wielded the strength of 100 men and women. Joquo also became a story that parents would tell their kids. "Don't act out or Joquo will decide to rebirth his legion of cruel ruthless beings to hunt you down!" Extreme? Yes, but it did work.

Fire Nation<br>
**Notable Events/Actions/Contributions:**

- Known as the Father of the Fire Nation Navy<br>

Nero rose through the ranks thanks to his work ethic and knack for being able to make the ship run more efficiently. At the age of 45 he became an Admiral and was allowed the freedom to run the Engineering Corps. For years he and his team worked on creating a new class of ship to use in the war. They made several breakthroughs and the end product was the prototype for the type of ship the Fire Nation still uses to this day. These ships were quickly put into production and accelerated the rate at which the Fire Nation could move troops.
