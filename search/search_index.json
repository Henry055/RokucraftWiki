Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it. Enjoy! Go to the Harbor Town School and head up the stairs to meet the Art Teacher. Once you find the Art Teacher click him to be warped into the Art Class. In the Art Class there will be options available for you to buy a canvas (middle) to begin. You will also be able to buy an Art Copier (left) to make copies of your final product later on. With your new canvas go place it on one of the easels and right click on it to sit down and begin painting. To get our variety of paints and tools go into your inventory to access them. Now it's time to begin painting onto the canvas! To paint, click the Canvas with different colours. Right-Click and drag to draw lines and curves. You can also click with a Paint Bucket and a colour in your offhand to fill in an area. If you mess up or want to restart you can do /artmap clear while painting! When you are happy with your painting and are finished you have two options to save it. You can use /artmap save <title> or use the canvas saving tool that will be in your inventory. When saving your painting's name make sure you don't put spaces in it because if it's lost in the future it won't be able to be recovered. Now that you have made a painting you can make copies of it to sell or place in an item frame. You can make copies by combining your painting with an Art Copier bought at the Art Class. Painted by LegoNerd2014 Painting is full of endless creativity. Once you begin to practise you can begin to make masterpieces using cool tricks like placing multiple canvases next to each other to make bigger paintings. Here's an example made by one of our players!","title":"Art"},{"location":"gameplay/art/#art-tutorial","text":"Want to learn how to paint beautiful paintings to decorate your home or sell to others?

The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.\u201d As a waterbender you have fairly strong defensive and offensive attacks. You will be able to form shields in different ways as well as harming your opponent from different kinds of water and ice moves. Water\u2019s biggest weakness is it\u2019s lack of mobility. Thankfully, this compensates with the pretty good defence that waterbending has to offer. If waterbenders are near a water source, they will be able to use all kinds of utility moves. Whether this is an air bubble to keep you from drowning, or to allow you to swim faster than benders from other elements. Earth Bending \ud83d\udd17 \u201cEarth is the element of substance, the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring.\u201d The key to being an Earthbender is to wait and listen for the right moment to strike. When the moment comes, you must act decisively. On the server, you have a lot of tactical moves. They could trick, trap, or blind your opponent. This can be effective when combined with other moves. Earthbending has both a good defence and a good variety of offensive moves. As an earthbender, you are able to catapult yourself in the air, or move yourself around, as long as you are surrounded by earth. Although earth has decent mobility, offence and defence, you are often required to stand on earth to be able to perform the move. Earth is also somewhat slow and not very dynamic. Fire Bending \ud83d\udd17 \u201cFire is the element of power, the people of the Fire Nation have desire, will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.\u201d Firebending on the server is just like the show, the element is known for it\u2019s intense and powerful attacks. On the server you will have the biggest choice of offensive moves that are meant to harm your opponent. You will have the most variety in attacks as a Firebender. But watch out! Firebending can also be harmful to you, if you are not careful enough. Fire\u2019s biggest weakness is it\u2019s lack of defensive moves. As a firebender, you are able to propel yourself in the air, or just on the ground. You will have a few moves that are meant for mobility for in or or outside of combat. Air Bending \ud83d\udd17 \u201cAir is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.\u201d Airbending is known for it\u2019s dynamic and wide variation of mobility. On the server, you will find a lot of moves that involve mobility. This extends from just jumping super high up, to the famous Airscooter, a move invented by Avatar Aang himself. The effectiveness of an Airbender\u2019s defence relies on mobility. An Airbender will mostly use their mobility to avoid incoming attacks from opponents. For an Airbender, you will have less choice when it comes to offensive moves. Harmful moves will be limited, but still fair enough to defeat an opponent.","title":"Bending"},{"location":"gameplay/bending/#bending","text":"","title":"Bending"},{"location":"gameplay/bending/#water-bending","text":"\u201cWater is the element of change.

All defenders in court are innocent until proven guilty by the evidence. The evidence has to be presented in court by the prosecution/plaintiffs. If the evidence is not sufficient it will be thrown out of court, and if no new evidence surfaces, the case will be dismissed. The Judge will be unbiased and should be certain without a doubt that the defendant is guilty before allowing a punishment. There are two types of courts in the Earth Kingdom, there is the Low Court and the High Court. The Low Court will hear mostly all of the cases in the Earth Kingdom, it will deal with everything from rare cases in Superior and Sovereign law. The High Court uses a jury system of randomized citizens of the Earth Kingdom (this is not used in Low Court). A case becomes High Court of the King signs off on it from the Grand Judge. In rare cases, those who are proven guilty in the High Court may seek redemption. If deemed worthy they will receive a second chance in society, but if deemed unworthy they will be banished or executed from the Kingdom. Roles \ud83d\udd17 The Grand Judge The Grand Judge is the head of the court system in the Earth Kingdom. They are the face of justice and law when it comes to these types of situations. They may preside over all cases if needed, but they are the only type of Judge that may preside over the High Court along with the other bodies. The Judge The Judge is appointed by the Grand Judge. They may preside over all Low Court trials and enforce punishments. They are also leading justice figures of the Earth Kingdom. The Grand Secretariat (Only in High Court) The Grand Secretariat is the cultural leader of the Earth Kingdom. They will serve alongside the Grand Judge and the Chancellor in such special occasions of High Court. They will judge the accused with an unbiased eye. The Chancellor (Only in High Court) The Chancellor is the head of internal government of the Earth Kingdom. They will serve alongside the Grand Judge and the Grand Secretariat in such special occasions of High Court. They will judge the accused with an unbiased eye. Prosecution/Plaintiff The Prosecution/Plaintiff is the accuser in the court, they are here to try and charge the Defendant and their team with a crime (making them guilty). They will present evidence to make their case, and reasoning. Defendant/Defence The Defendant/Defence is the accused in the court, they are here to prove themselves innocent. They will make a defending argument against the accusers and submit evidence on their side if any is tanginable. The Jury (Only in High Court) The Jury will serve as another unbiased party, only in the cases of the High Court. They will consist of Earth Kingdom citizens and give their opinion on the case after all sides are presented. They will make a statement of innocence or guilt. Witnesses If there is an able witness to the crime being discussed they may be called upon in court by either party. The party that called upon them will question them, and if necessary the opposite party will cross examine. Handler - The Handler in court will serve as the communication between the Judge and the parties. They will remain at the side of the Judge throughout the case delivering evidence, and if necessary stopping riots in the courtroom. Court Steps \ud83d\udd17 The High Court follows these procedures with 3 judges listed above. The Law Court ignores the Jury and does not have one. The Handler will welcome the presiding Judge of the court, and once the Judge sits down it is proper to bow on one knee until the gavel is slammed on Earth Kingdom Gold. The Handler will address both parties and recite the case\u2019s title. They will then give a brief synopsis on why the court case is happening and tell the story line. Each side of the defendant and the prosecution will be allowed to give an opening statement that will be limited to one chat message. Anything more and the Judge will limit their speech in the court. The Prosecutor/Plaintiff will deliver their argument on the case and aim to hit these guidelines. Keep this relatively brief not spanning more than 10-15 minutes. What laws has the Defendant broken? Why are they guilty? What evidence? Are they too strayed to be put back into society? What parameters should be taken for punishment? The Defendant/Defence will deliver their argument on the case and aim to hit these guidelines. Keep this relatively brief not spanning more than 10-15 minutes. Are you guilty or not guilty? If innocent, how did you not break the law? If the Defence pleads guilty, what punishment will they recommend? Is there a chance of redemption? (The Judge may interrupt if steps 4 and 5 are taking too long). (During the process of step 6 objections may be called.) If there are Witnesses from either side of the court they will be addressed now (witnesses will be limited to one per party, unless under certain circumstances). If no witnesses move to step 7. Defence/Prosecution will question their own and each other's witness. Whichever side called upon the witness will go first, the other party will follow. (Keep this to max 2 questions per witness from each side). Rebuttal/Closing statements from both sides will be made, and no objections from either side will be allowed. If they choose, they will address the points made in each other's arguments and rebuttal them. These will be kept for four-six chat messages (if more Judges may step in and cut short). (Skip this procedure if not in High Court, and move to step 9) If this is the High Court the Jury will now give their opinion after a 5 minute recess.

In this 5 minute break the Judge will leave the room to come up with a verdict. They will sentance the defendant if they are found guilty. If the guilty is sentenced to death, banishment, or life in prison they may seek redemption (May only happen as a consequence of the High Court\u2019s decision) . Seeking Redemption \ud83d\udd17 In the chance that a person is found guilty by the High Court it means they are at the very end of the line. They are at the walls, and the angry platypus bears are barking at them, and getting ready to eat. Here they may prove themselves and have a second chance in society. If they prove themselves worthy they will get to live another day in society, and will be given the chance to change their fate. Seeking redemption is an endurance test. The guilty will be put under a suspended boulder. This boulder weighs more than 2 tons on a bad day. Depending on your crime you may be given a heavy boulder or a light boulder. Either way, the weight of the boulder will be almost impossible to carry unless you are masterful in your bending. You will be under the rock for 10 minutes. Every minute on the minute we will check how your endurance is going. If the rock squashes on you, well your fate will have been sealed and you will be dead. You will be able to use your bending. If you are a non bender, well, maybe this test isn't the best option. But for the sake of it give it your best shot. OOC For 10 minutes, every minute on the minute you will roll for your life. If you roll a 13+ you have survived that minute. If you roll below a 13 you will be taking a considerable amount of inches into the ground. Once you have sinked a certain amount of inches, no matter what the rock will fall on you. For example, you may have just rolled a 12, but your next roll is a 20. If your roll again and it is low it may be the end for you depending about how poorly you have rolled before.

It takes the space of a whole continent and many islands surrounding it. In the past, the Earth Kingdom has been known as a defensive nation. During the Hundred Year War the Earth Kingdom stayed in a constant defensive state, and its main capital Ba Sing Se was not penetrated until the end of the war. After the war, the Earth Kingdom decided to make peace with the Fire Nation, and help rebuild the Air Collective. Many of the Earth Kingdom villages are currently left with little resources and many. The provinces of the Earth Kingdom are lead by Mayors and Governors, which are overseen by the Grand Secretariat and the Earth Monarchs. The Earth Kingdom has also let in a new Air Collective village, called Gynaste. This is a new mix of diversity of in the Earth Kingdom. Present \ud83d\udd17 During the Earth and Fire war Earth Queen Kyo faced a lot of pressure, once a treaty was met she decided to step down. After Earth Queen Kyo stepped down from the throne she looked to the spirits to announce the new monarch of the Kingdom. She decided to coronate the current Grand Secretariat, Habien Hanri. Habien Hanri's coronation took place at Fong's Fortress. He was crowned as the 55th Earth monarch of the Kingdom, now he currently leads the Earth Kingdom to try and bring prosperity to the nation. Government \ud83d\udd17 The government of the Earth Kingdom is an Absolute Monarchy. The Earth Kingdom is ran by a King and or Queen. These monarchs reside in the great city of Ba Sing Se, where they oversee the other lands of the Earth Kingdom. Though, there is another government head under the monarch, being the Grand Secretariat. The Grand Secretariat is in charge of the Dai Li, the protectors of the culture in the Earth Kingdom. The Earth Kingdom has a military that is used for war, lead by a council of five generals and the Grand Secretariat. The land of the Earth Kingdom is split into city states and provinces. For instance, Kyoshi Island is a city state of the Earth Kingdom. It has its own separate government, but still falls under the Earth Kingdom. Mosty city states and provinces are lead by Governors of that given area. These provinces of the Earth Kingdom could possibly create their own army or militia. For instance, the Kyoshi Warriors falling under the land of Kyoshi Island. Government System: Absolute Monarchy Head of State: Earth King and Queen Head of Government: Grand Secretariat Territorial Divisions: Various villages, provinces & regions Heads of Territorial Divisions: Governors & Mayors Capital: Ba Sing Se Culture \ud83d\udd17 The Earth Kingdom being the largest out of the four nations many different cultures were created. No single culture could take over the whole kingdom, just because of the sheer size of the continent. Many trends swept through the Earth Kingdom, some being royal culture, common culture, and sand bender (desert) culture. Royal Earth Kingdom \ud83d\udd17 In the Earth Kingdom the royal family created trends for the richer people of the kingdom to follow. The richer people of the Earth Kingdom reside in estates and large houses. They may even have a known family name that is spread around the world. Being like this, the richer people in the Earth Kingdom create their own culture of business and luxury. Most being able to invest in their own companies and creations. Some even tend to get high into the government to feel closer to the monarchs of the kingdom. Commoners \ud83d\udd17 The common people of the Earth Kingdom live in the middle-lower rings of Ba Sing Se and in just other cities in general. Most of these people work in a hard labor job, working hard for their money. These people of the Earth Kingdom are more open and show more hospitality than their counterparts. The common people may not always make a great change in the kingdom, but they hold it together in ways that the government cannot. Being this majority party creates lifestyles that can be different than the richer people of the kingdom. Sand Bender (Desert) \ud83d\udd17 The sandbenders in the Earth Kingdom are so diversely different than the other majority in the kingdom that they obtain their own name and culture. Most living in areas around the desert, like Misty Palms Oasis. They wear clothing that travels all the way up their head and around their body. This protects them from sand and the heat of the desert. They create a sub group to earthbending, making sand bending of that degree rarer in the richer parts of the Earth Kingdom. They are also given the bad name of being thieves in the Earth Kingdom. History \ud83d\udd17 During the era of Raava people acquire their earthbending by the lion turtles. The people of this old era lived on top of the lion turtles backs. With the creation of the Avatar, the people of the lion turtles cities began to descend from them and explore the land known as the Earth Kingdom. Being the largest body of land in the world many people explored different areas. This giving each area of the Earth Kingdom a group of people. The that descended from the backs of the lion turtles obtained the power of earth bending, the ability to manipulate earth. From then on, the people of the Earth Kingdom have resided in the great continent. Ancient History \ud83d\udd17 After descending the lion turtles back the people of the Earth Kingdom began to settle amongst the vast lands of the continent. Many battles and wars started to break out in the continent. The people of the old Earth Kingdom did not unite under one culture because of how spread out the land mass was, unlike the other nations. In other nations, the cultures prevailed and the people united under it, but not in the Earth Kingdom. In this period of war, two big main cities arose from the ruble. One being, out of the crystal catacombs Ba Sing Se. The other being born out of love, Omashu. Ba Sing Se, the current capital of the Earth Kingdom was not always fortified. It was invaded many times, but eventually it grew in power and strength. The king of Ba Sing Se declared himself the king of the Earth Kingdom, but the kingdom was too big. This is where the other providences and city states of the Earth Kingdom came into play. Other leaders of the Earth Kingdom ruled their terrains, but they did not rule over the entire Earth Kingdom like the Earth King. Hundred Year War \ud83d\udd17 Before the Hundred Year War the four nations lived in peace and harmony. Then the Fire Nation became industrialized and set out to kill the next born avatar in the Air Collective. After the death of Avatar Roku, Fire Lord Sozin decided to genocide the Air Nomads. In hope of killing the Avatar, and having his plan to take over the four nations possible. During this hundred year period Avatar Aang was stuck in an iceberg just near the Southern Water Tribe. With the Avatar gone for a hundred years, the Earth Kingdom was invaded countless times. Many Earth Kingdom provinces falling to the Fire Nation, the first being Taku, and later bigger cities such as Omashu and Ba Sing Se. The Fire Nation Military tried countless times to penetrate the capital of Ba Sing Se, but did not succeed until the end of the war. After the war, the Earth Kingdom began to regrow back from the smudge that the left war on the kingdom. Past Events \ud83d\udd17 Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation War \ud83d\udd17 After the end of the Rebel War, the four nations gained stability and was pushed into a short temporary era of peace. In honor of the Avatar's mastery over all four elements the Royal Earth Kingdom family decided to host a ball in her honor. The Earth Kingdom Ball would be known as the beginning of the war. For in the ball, Earth Princess Hana went missing. Rumors grew like wild fires in the room, and some pointed to the Fire Lords Advisor Xaon as the culprit. During the Ball, the Earth Queen demanded for the immediate custody. Soon after the Ball the Earth Kingdom lead an immediate search and rescue mission for the Princess, a mysterious sand bender lead the expedition to Haggyo Island where they found the Princess sitting in the Viper's Clan old base. The guard protecting the base said that the Fire Lord and Advisor Xaon orders him to watch her. This pushed tensions in-between the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom. Fire Nation Ship Raid \ud83d\udd17 In attempt to deal damage onto the Fire Nation the Earth Queen order a raid of a Fire Nation's Admiral ship. This raid was lead by Grand Secretariat Ako, and it was a coalition of Earth Kingdom Military members and Water Tribe members who wanted to side with the Earth Kingdom in the War. In this raid the coalition stole a lot of Fire Nation cargo being, weapons, supplies, and food. This event further escalated the differences between the two nations, and started involving the Water Tribe to side with the Fire Nation. Ember Island Attack \ud83d\udd17 In a war meeting consisting of high up officials of the Earth Kingdom the Queen and her advisors decided to invade Ember Island. This invasion was to show that the Earth Kingdom was not scared of going all out, and that they were not to be messed with again. So, the Earth Kingdom invaded Ember Island. The Earth Kingdom Military was driven out by the Fire Lord and his army, and they returned with many losses back to their kingdom. Jehung Attack \ud83d\udd17 In response to the Ember Island attack the Fire Nation decided to try and invade the Earth Kingdom city Jehung. This was the second battle of the ongoing war, though this time the battle was intervened by a third party, Avatar Sialuk. The Avatar got in-between the fighting of the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation, and stopped the battle before it could get even more escalated. In response, the Earth Queen order Grand Secretariat Ako to attack her, but she refused. This refusal of an order from the Queen lead to her immediate termination, and Ako was banished from the Kingdom. After the battle, the Queen put her new Grand Secretariat Habien Hanri into work, he was previously serving as General in the Earth Kingdom Military.

Once a Mayor has won their election they will be responsible for bringing roleplay to the city. They will have to host frequent role plays in the city. They will also be responsible for communicating amongst the King\u2019s advisors about what is needed in the village/city. They have to make the people of their village happy. If there are organizations attacking their land, they must figure out ways on how to respond to it. Inactivity If you are elected Mayor and become inactive you will be removed from the position. If you have to take an absence, please let the King know. If you decide you do not have to do work because there is no one challenging your office you are mistaken. You may not remain inactive even if you have won an election. Requirements for Running \ud83d\udd17 You must be an Earthbender or Earth Kingdom Citizen (denounce your citizenship of another nation if not an earthbender). Your character must be of the age 21 or older. Your character must also not have any known criminal record in the Earth Kingdom. You must have a rented residential property in the village/city you are running in. You must be known for that city, meaning you have to have role plays there and your character must have a reason for running. (You cannot just run in the city right when you have rented a house. You must make a name for yourself.) Host frequent role plays in the village/city you want to run for mayor in. These role plays should not all be generic and casual. Make the role plays have meaning, for instance, role play about how to fix local issues. Remember, the goal is to make your character memorable in the city. Once you have done these following requirements you may contact the Earth King to move onto the next steps in running for Mayor. Running for Mayor \ud83d\udd17 Every time someone is to run for mayor there will be an official voting system. (This will be done by google form). Even if there is no one running against said player, there will still be a voting form. You have to campaign for Mayor. Once you are given the \u2018Green light\u2019 from the King you have to create a forum post. This forum post will have to outline your plans for mayorship, reasons for running, and why they should vote for you, ect. (Still has to be done even if run unopposed). There will be a set period of time where you will have to campaign. The King will communicate with all candidates and set up a timetable for the campaign. (The election campaign may run for 1-2 weeks depending on circumstances.) Once the following steps have been done, and you have won the election you will be named Mayor of the village/city. Re-elections \ud83d\udd17 Info After 3 months of the incumbent's original day of taking office they are allowed to be challenged in an election. If no one decided to run against the incumbent after the original 3 months then they will maintain status without having to re-run. This means that you can remain Mayor for 8 months without having to be re-elected, unless another player decides to run against you. You can only call for a new election 3 months after the current incumbent has taken office. Once a new election is called between the candidates, the King will call for a new time table.

What punishment should the Magistrate inflict? The Defendant will then present their argument to the Court. Their argument should consider the following: Is the client pleading guilty or not guilty? Why/how the Defendant did not breach the law. What should the Court take into consideration? (for example, were they forced to commit those actions? Do other people rely upon this individual?) Are there alternative sentencing options that the court should consider? Do they have the potential to reform? Witness examination can occur depending on the case.

After the Hundred Year War however, in Fire Lord Zuko's reign, the Fire Nation became much more peaceful and benevolent population. This trend has continued for the most part in modern time even after Zuko's rule. Many Fire Nation cities and villages are located on volcanic islands, such as Ember Island and even the Capital being located inside a dormant volcano. While the other nations are mostly located on whole pieces of land, the Fire Nation encompasses hundreds of islands differing in size. The Fire Nation has also withdrawn from most colonies in the Earth Kingdom, but there are still a few remaining on their land, leading to Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation citizens mixing, creating more ethnically diverse towns. Present \ud83d\udd17 During Fire Lord Ryuu Ozaki's reign, the Fire Nation flourished under her peaceful rule for a short while. However, crime slowly began to increase in which danger felt ever present to the people of the Fire Nation. Fire Lord Ryuu Ozaki felt that it was essential for her to return to her roots, so it was critical for her to find a successor that would have the potential to return the Fire Nation to its once thriving state. Her cousin, Xelin Ozaki, was selected to be her successor and was crowned at Coronation Plaza, in the Fire Nation Capital. The criminal organisations are yet to be eliminated; however, this remains to be Fire Lord Xelin Ozaki's number one priority. He wishes to rule over a harmonious and blossoming Fire Nation that the other nations may view as an ally. Government \ud83d\udd17 Previously, the Fire Nation was ruled by a council of Fire Sages and focused on philosophy and spirituality, much alike to the Air Nomads. The leader of the council was called the Fire Lord, but eventually broke off from the group and became the sole ruler of the nation. The government of the Fire Nation now is an absolute monarchy, with the Fire Lord and their cabinet for advice. The cabinet consists of a Royal Secretariat, Prime Minister, High Magistrate, High Sage and Lord. During the days of the Hundred Year War, the Fire Sages pledged their loyalty to the Fire Lord, but after Fire Lord Zuko came to power, they once again pledged their loyalty to the Avatar instead while still remaining as the religious authority over the Fire Nation. During the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation took control of some Earth Kingdom towns, and still have control over them in current day, though efforts in peacemaking have reduced the amount of Fire Nation controlled towns. Government System: Partial Monarchy, Parliamentary System Head of State: Fire Lord Head of Government: Cabinet Territorial Divisions: The land mass of the Fire Nation, including some small colonies in the Earth Kingdom Religious Authority: Fire Sages Capital: Caldera City Culture \ud83d\udd17 While the Fire Nation itself has immensely changed, its culture has stayed relatively same. Firebenders value the idea of honor and respect, especially towards elders and nobility. Though fight to the death Agni Kais are now outlawed, duels for honor still happen. Appearance is extremely important in the Fire Nation. Nobility and high ranking officials are often dressed in precious cloth, and armor made with the finest metal lined with gold. Most sacred Fire Nation buildings are pagoda-like, and sport the Fire Nation symbol as well as a picture of the Fire Lord. Fire Nation cuisine often has some sort of spice in it, including regular dishes, festival food, and tea. Because of the Fire Nation's rocky and hilly terrain, pastures for animals are much more common than land for farming, which means most of the nation's dishes have meat in them. Even with the Fire Nation's uptight customs, festivals with an abundance of fun activities, plays, and food are very common in the nation. Some of the most popular destinations to attend for leisure are the Fire Days Festival, Fire Nation Circus and Fire Lily Festivals. History \ud83d\udd17 During the era of Raava, people acquired their firebending from lion turtles. With time, these people came together as a group and formed the Fire Nation, exploring the western landmass and settling there. With the urge to explore, warriors from the Fire Nation set off to discover and expand into the unknown lands. This pattern is once again repeated during the Hundred Year War. Ancient History \ud83d\udd17 Before the Fire Lord, the Fire Nation was split into constant fighting with many different sides battling one another. One of these sides were the Sun Warriors. They learned firebending from the dragons and also had a flourishing civilization, but some rumors say they went into hiding because they pushed out by the warring groups near their city. Other sides were led by warlords hoping to snatch land for themselves and often resorting to brutish and vile methods to force villages to their command. However, all of these conflicts ceased to exist after one person rose to power and combined all people into a whole nation again. This person was known as the first Fire Lord, which at that time was the leader of the Fire Sages. While the Fire Nation was ruled for some time by the Fire Lord and the Fire Sages equally, the Fire Lord at some point split from the other sages and turned them and their family into the absolute rulers of the Fire Nation. Much of Fire Nation history is recorded by Fire Sages and kept in the Dragonbone Catacombs. These records hold specific accounts of myths, important events and personal pieces of writing within them. Hundred Year War \ud83d\udd17 As the infamous aggressor of the war, the Fire Nation has received extreme criticism from starting this war. Fire Lord Sozin used the power of the comet to raze the air temples, and continued on his conquest across the entire world. During the year 100 AG, Avatar Aang was able to defeat Fire Lord Ozai before he was able to use Sozin's Comet to burn the Earth Kingdom down, similarly to his predecessor. Road to Redemption \ud83d\udd17 After the Hundred Year War, Fire Lord Zuko rose to power and ushered in a new era of peace along with Avatar Aang. Fire Lord Seb now continues on that path first paved by Zuko, hoping to show the rest of the world that the Fire Nation is not what it once was. Past Events \ud83d\udd17 The ATRA \ud83d\udd17 Along with the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation signed the Air Temple Restoration Agreement to help restore the Air Temples that were destroyed by Sozin. The agreement outlined that the Fire Nation would be providing the resources for the rebuilding along with their most advanced technology to help with construction. The ATRA is currently half fulfilled, with the Southern Air Temple and Western Air Temple having been restored already. The Rebel War \ud83d\udd17 The Fire Nation was one of the two main opposing sides in this war. First provoked by the Ember Island theatre assassination attempt the nation and the Water Tribe launched numerous attacks against each other, eventually brought together for a peace treaty after the death of Princess Tae and the reveal of the Spiritual Shaman Justin being the mastermind behind the entire war. The Third War \ud83d\udd17 Once again dragged into another war, the Earth Kingdom accused the Fire Lord and his ex-advisor Xaon of kidnapping and torturing Queen Kyo's daughter, Princess Hana. It was found out later that this rumor was incorrect and it was instead the Red Lotus who framed the entire thing on the Fire Nation. During the war, the Fire Nation stayed mainly on the defense, but with their last attack on Fong's Fortress, the war ended. The New Fire Lord \ud83d\udd17 Even after Fire Lord Seb's attempts to maintain peace, two wars still broke out during his rule. After reflection, he decided to give up his throne to another firebender in an attempt to bring fresh eyes and ideas to the nation. As his only son disappeared and didn't have any other heir, he gave the throne to War Minister Ryuu Ozaki. She was crowned the new Fire Lord and immediately took steps to appoint a Cabinet to aid her in making better decisions for the Fire Nation.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"nations/fire/fire-nation/#the-fire-nation-lore","text":"The Fire Nation has been historically known as violent conquerors of the world, committing the infamous genocide of the Air Nomads as well as Fire Lord Ozai's plan to scorch the Earth Kingdom to the ground.

The first settlers of Angnikuyaak (or called Angniku by its people) decided to keep themselves sheltered from the tundra by creating small rooms to huddle in inside of the mountain. Many years after, a whole society was built inside and outside of the mountain. Upon mining further into the mountain, the people had discovered crystals in the ground that soon became the center of their society. Society \ud83d\udd17 The Angniku believe that each crystal represents the extension of one\u2019s spirit and their placement in their society. These are determined by the Elder Shaman of the village as they are believed to carry the ability to see what crystal resonates with each child. The Elder Shaman is the leader of the people, and they\u2019re essentially the Chieftain of the Angniku. The crystal the child is given shortly after birth becomes that person's name [Example: Kya Clear Quartz] and it also represents their social standing/job in the tribe. If someone was to break their crystal then they are to be banished from the tribe as it is believed that the spirits who break your crystal curse you. Those who are deemed cursed may only return once every 5 years when a traditional ceremony is held to honor the spirits. During this time the banished ones may plead for forgiveness and bring an offering to them in return for a new crystal. If one does not get accepted then they are sentenced to exile forever. Once someone is banished their families may not speak to them ever again or they too will be banished, for they chose their family over their own culture. Hierarchy \ud83d\udd17 Diamonds - Elder Shamans: These are very rarely given to a baby. They\u2019re only given to the next chosen Elder of the tribe. Those who own them are treated like royalty, and train their whole lives to become the next leader of the Angniku. Moonstone - Shamans: The other spiritually gifted shamans are the aristocratic people of the tribe and are often advisors to the elder or work closely with them. They hold rituals, rites, and give offerings to the spirits. More on them can be found here Agates - Warriors: The Warriors are the defenders of the tribe and highly respected for doing so. Their strain of agate will determine what kind of warrior or strengths they possess. Quartz - Hunters: The Hunters are responsible for bringing food and pelts back to the people from outside of the tribe itself. They\u2019re very important to the survival of the tribe. Pearl - Healers: The Healers are very obviously respected and needed for their abilities. If you do not have a pearl and are a bender it\u2019s very disrespectful for you to be taught healing. Topaz - Traders: The Traders travel to other villages and exchange mined materials for other goods like fish and agriculture. Sapphire - Teachers: The Teachers are responsible for training the youth whether it be in bending, combat, or the history of the entire tribe/world. Zircon - Cooks: The Cooks are obviously important for their providing of the whole tribe food. The cooks are also the ones who arrange feasts and such to honor those in their tribe. Other: Those with wildly specific other gems will get to join nearly any job and still be respected. They may not be Elder Shaman or Healers due to societal standards, however. Customs \ud83d\udd17 Names: A child\u2019s first name the parents give at birth, and once the child's crystal is chosen the crystal becomes their middle and last names. Attire: Clothes of any kind are allowed, although the Angni tend to wear outfits with many furs to keep themselves warm against the cold mountain winds. Your crystal needs to be secure and visible on your clothing or hair, as it is a part of you and defines your role. Rites: When a child is 8 they will be sent out with 2 other children of their tribe and tasked with returning home with a dead polar bear. No matter what crystal you have it is important that you use your skill to return home with the bear. If you return without it you will be banished. Greetings: One would say \u201cSpirit shine on you brother/sister\u201d and grip the forearm of the other person while extending their index and middle finger to displace peace. Insults: Clod, Dim One, Kuum! Social Norms: The people of Angni are very close knit and respect each other\u2019s roles in the clan, as everyone is deemed important, although there is a greater respect held for people such as shamans. Outsiders are not treated with much kindness and will be shunned socially or forced out if they manage to enter. They aren\u2019t banished, however, unless they do something extremely disrespectful and/or rude. If one leaves the clan to live permanently outside of it they will be banished. There is no way for outsiders to become Angnikuyaak. Relationships: Those in the Angni don\u2019t have many restrictions on them when it comes to relationships inside the clan, unless one is a shaman or the Elder Shaman. Shamans do not date, marry, or have children. More on shamans can be found in the document pasted above. Those who leave the clan to have a relationship with someone outside of it will be banished. Marriage Rituals: To propose to someone, one must first receive a blessing from their parents or any other close family member should their parents be absent (if the person simply has no family to do this with, one shall use a close friend of theirs instead. If this doesn\u2019t work either just skip this step). From here one must take their time throughout the day to present the person in question with gifts and offerings, and spend their entire day with them. Finally, when it is midnight, one must bring their significant other to the top of the mountains under the stars (it is said that the clearer the sky is that night, the more successful the proposal will be) and present them with one\u2019s own crystal, which is a sign of utmost admiration, trust, and love towards the other person. If the other person accepts, the two will exchange crystals and come back down to the village to sleep in their own homes with their significant other\u2019s crystal for the night. This is the only time where it is acceptable for someone to give their crystal to another. Then right at dawn, one must return back to their fiance and give their crystal back. The ritual is complete and the two are now engaged. Death Ceremonies: When one of the Angniku dies, the clan first begins by arranging a spot atop the mountains for the body to be buried. They say the closer to the sky you are, the better the spirits will take care of you. The people gather around their body, not yet buried, and sit in silence out of respect. Then everyone stands up and departs back down the mountain, except for family and close friends. They stay for additional prayer to wish the departed\u2019s spirit well before burying them in the snow. Pets: Pets such as arctic hens, hare sheep, and white hamsters are common, but there are a few pets that have significant connections to stones. Polar bears, and polar bear dogs respectively, tend to only be owned by agates who may use them in battle, and wolves are owned by those higher up in the clan. To have a wolf means one is worthy of great respect. Holidays \ud83d\udd17 The Night of Yukara There is one night of the year where the stars in the sky are at their brightest, and dazzling meteors fly through the pitch dark. This night always falls on the first full moon of January, and is called the night of Yukara by the Angniku people, named after the moonstone who discovered that this night was the brightest of them all in the first place. Those who stay up late in the night to witness this event to its fullest will see the night sky dotted with thousands and thousands of bright stars. Water Tribe constellations are fully visible from the ground as one gazes up. Families and individuals alike gather together outside their homes and in the snow to just look at the stars, and sometimes bond over making up their own constellations. People also love to watch the meteor showers as they find it quite beautiful. To the vendors and stalls around the market, this is a day where they can sell special sweets that would usually be in lower stock such as joon berry sauce and mooncakes, which are popular with the excited children taking part in this day. They eat the treats under the stars with their family and friends. For shamans, especially those who follow Xiyue, this is a blessed day where the spirits are at their most prominent and powerful. They will hold a special Yukara rite in the moonstone temple and pray for Angniku\u2019s safety, fortune, and luck. To the Xiyue followers, the constellations mean even more than just simple naming and beauty. Constellations are said to be families reuniting, and they treat these constellations with respect and mourning. Every star is someone who has passed, and someone the spirits will watch over with their gentle care. The night of Yukara isn\u2019t a holiday that\u2019s celebrated with a grand festival, or any type of party. It\u2019s a quiet, peaceful, yet powerful staple of the Angniku\u2019s culture, and this day brings them together in a way they can share and look forward to each year.

The first settlers of Angnikuyaak (or called Angniku by its people) decided to keep themselves sheltered from the tundra by creating small rooms to huddle in inside of the mountain. Many years after, a whole society was built inside and outside of the mountain. Upon mining further into the mountain, the people had discovered crystals in the ground that soon became the center of their society.","title":"The Angniku of Angnikuyaak"},{"location":"nations/water/angniku-clan/#society","text":"The Angniku believe that each crystal represents the extension of one\u2019s spirit and their placement in their society. These are determined by the Elder Shaman of the village as they are believed to carry the ability to see what crystal resonates with each child. The Elder Shaman is the leader of the people, and they\u2019re essentially the Chieftain of the Angniku. The crystal the child is given shortly after birth becomes that person's name [Example: Kya Clear Quartz] and it also represents their social standing/job in the tribe. If someone was to break their crystal then they are to be banished from the tribe as it is believed that the spirits who break your crystal curse you. Those who are deemed cursed may only return once every 5 years when a traditional ceremony is held to honor the spirits. During this time the banished ones may plead for forgiveness and bring an offering to them in return for a new crystal. If one does not get accepted then they are sentenced to exile forever. Once someone is banished their families may not speak to them ever again or they too will be banished, for they chose their family over their own culture.","title":"Society"},{"location":"nations/water/angniku-clan/#hierarchy","text":"Diamonds - Elder Shamans: These are very rarely given to a baby. They\u2019re only given to the next chosen Elder of the tribe. Those who own them are treated like royalty, and train their whole lives to become the next leader of the Angniku. Moonstone - Shamans: The other spiritually gifted shamans are the aristocratic people of the tribe and are often advisors to the elder or work closely with them. They hold rituals, rites, and give offerings to the spirits. More on them can be found here Agates - Warriors: The Warriors are the defenders of the tribe and highly respected for doing so. Their strain of agate will determine what kind of warrior or strengths they possess. Quartz - Hunters: The Hunters are responsible for bringing food and pelts back to the people from outside of the tribe itself. They\u2019re very important to the survival of the tribe. Pearl - Healers: The Healers are very obviously respected and needed for their abilities. If you do not have a pearl and are a bender it\u2019s very disrespectful for you to be taught healing. Topaz - Traders: The Traders travel to other villages and exchange mined materials for other goods like fish and agriculture. Sapphire - Teachers: The Teachers are responsible for training the youth whether it be in bending, combat, or the history of the entire tribe/world. Zircon - Cooks: The Cooks are obviously important for their providing of the whole tribe food. The cooks are also the ones who arrange feasts and such to honor those in their tribe. Other: Those with wildly specific other gems will get to join nearly any job and still be respected.

Attire: Clothes of any kind are allowed, although the Angni tend to wear outfits with many furs to keep themselves warm against the cold mountain winds. Your crystal needs to be secure and visible on your clothing or hair, as it is a part of you and defines your role. Rites: When a child is 8 they will be sent out with 2 other children of their tribe and tasked with returning home with a dead polar bear. No matter what crystal you have it is important that you use your skill to return home with the bear. If you return without it you will be banished. Greetings: One would say \u201cSpirit shine on you brother/sister\u201d and grip the forearm of the other person while extending their index and middle finger to displace peace. Insults: Clod, Dim One, Kuum! Social Norms: The people of Angni are very close knit and respect each other\u2019s roles in the clan, as everyone is deemed important, although there is a greater respect held for people such as shamans. Outsiders are not treated with much kindness and will be shunned socially or forced out if they manage to enter. They aren\u2019t banished, however, unless they do something extremely disrespectful and/or rude. If one leaves the clan to live permanently outside of it they will be banished. There is no way for outsiders to become Angnikuyaak. Relationships: Those in the Angni don\u2019t have many restrictions on them when it comes to relationships inside the clan, unless one is a shaman or the Elder Shaman. Shamans do not date, marry, or have children. More on shamans can be found in the document pasted above. Those who leave the clan to have a relationship with someone outside of it will be banished. Marriage Rituals: To propose to someone, one must first receive a blessing from their parents or any other close family member should their parents be absent (if the person simply has no family to do this with, one shall use a close friend of theirs instead. If this doesn\u2019t work either just skip this step). From here one must take their time throughout the day to present the person in question with gifts and offerings, and spend their entire day with them. Finally, when it is midnight, one must bring their significant other to the top of the mountains under the stars (it is said that the clearer the sky is that night, the more successful the proposal will be) and present them with one\u2019s own crystal, which is a sign of utmost admiration, trust, and love towards the other person. If the other person accepts, the two will exchange crystals and come back down to the village to sleep in their own homes with their significant other\u2019s crystal for the night. This is the only time where it is acceptable for someone to give their crystal to another. Then right at dawn, one must return back to their fiance and give their crystal back. The ritual is complete and the two are now engaged. Death Ceremonies: When one of the Angniku dies, the clan first begins by arranging a spot atop the mountains for the body to be buried. They say the closer to the sky you are, the better the spirits will take care of you. The people gather around their body, not yet buried, and sit in silence out of respect. Then everyone stands up and departs back down the mountain, except for family and close friends. They stay for additional prayer to wish the departed\u2019s spirit well before burying them in the snow. Pets: Pets such as arctic hens, hare sheep, and white hamsters are common, but there are a few pets that have significant connections to stones. Polar bears, and polar bear dogs respectively, tend to only be owned by agates who may use them in battle, and wolves are owned by those higher up in the clan. To have a wolf means one is worthy of great respect.","title":"Customs"},{"location":"nations/water/angniku-clan/#holidays","text":"The Night of Yukara There is one night of the year where the stars in the sky are at their brightest, and dazzling meteors fly through the pitch dark.

Most of the first and second generation Arenqii are from the Northern Water Tribe, part of the NWT\u2019s expedition to the sister tribe after the Hundred Year War to help rebuild and reintroduce waterbending to their fragile society. After the southern reconstruction began, many northerners decided to settle there permanently and intermingled with the locals. This hybridization of northern and southern peoples coalesced around a small Yutu village that eventually grew into the great Southern Water Tribe capital, Amaruq City. The result was a diverse clan tied together by close bonds of community and a shared northern heritage, but with a willingness to adapt to southern ways of life out of necessity and survival. Cultural Norms \ud83d\udd17 Due to their close heritage with the Northern Water Tribe, the Arenqii held onto several features of their homeland. In particular, they have a great pride in the art of waterbending and a sense of a strong and unified community. But living at the south pole came with many changes and hardships, requiring the Arenqii to adapt. For example, rather than confine women to the art of healing, like in the NWT, the Arenqii allow women to practice all forms of waterbending. Although, they tend to recommend military service only to men and still arrange marriages for their children. Their sense of community has also blended with southern ways of life, resulting in a very social-democratic form of society. That is to say, the Arenqii rely on communal decision-making, even distribution of everyday necessities, and a desire to fulfill the common good. As most members of the water tribes, the Arenqii also hold their elders and shamans in high regards, often looking to them to lead the community as beacons of wisdom - but unlike other tribes, the ultimate authority rests with the will of the greater community. Social Structure \ud83d\udd17 Lawspeaker - in place of a Chieftain; the Lawspeaker is the representative of Amaruq City, elected by the Yuks to be the leading and unifying voice for all Arenqii people and citizens of Amaruq City. The Lawspeaker must memorize the law, administrate city hall meetings, and enforce decisions made by the people of the city. Clan Elders - older members of the tribe who have come to deserve a peaceful retirement. The elders are taken care of by the rest of the community. Shamans - those with close connections to the spirits. Shamans can do many things, from funerals to weddings. Warriors - a strong community needs warriors to keep it safe. Arenqii people are very nationalistic and live to serve both their tribe and the greater Southern Water Tribe, as well. Merchants - in Amaruq City, the Arenqii live a more accommodating lifestyle than other tribes. Thus, many Arenqii people practice a certain trade in the city. These trades can vary widely, from fishermen to interior designers. Yuks - the basic \u201ccitizen\u201d unit of the tribe. When Arenqii boys and girls reach adulthood, they undergo a ceremonial rite of passage to acquire full tribal citizenship rights and responsibilities. Only Yuk\u2019s can take part in decision-making and certain public ceremonies. Traditions \ud83d\udd17 Kudlik - traditional oil lamps made from stone or pottery that burn the fat of arctic seals or whale-walruses to provide light and warmth Communal Gatherings - potlucks around a fire, usually in a large house or igloo featuring song and dance Pets - common pets include polar bear dogs, arctic camels, and white hamsters Arranged Marriages - like their NWT kin, many Arenqii practice this but are not nearly as strict, allowing a son or daughter to refuse the union. However, disarranging a marriage must be done ceremoniously at a gathering of the two families involved. Voting - Arenqii vote publically by dropping colored stones into a small pool of water. Each color represents a position. The color which the water turns nearest to is the verdict. If the color is ambiguous or significantly mixed, then an individual tally is taken. Adoption - Because the Arenqii do not have deep generational ties to their clan, outsiders are often adopted into the clan, but only after completing the Communal Rite of Passage where the individual must provide a generous worthy contribution of his or her own talents to the benefit of the entire community (i.e., a feast from a great hunt, tanned fur gifts, healing/spiritual ritual, etc.) Kudlikila Weddings - Kudlikila weddings are exclusive to only Yuks. While people from other tribes can watch, they can never have one of their own. It\u2019s often frowned upon for people of other nations to be invited, however no traditional rule. Kudlikila weddings can last anywhere from one day to several. The more femine outfit is often lighter, while a more masculine outfit for this occasion is darker. Outfits to wear aren\u2019t too rigid, however somewhat formal clothes and keeping with the color pallet is recommended. These weddings will often happen in the warmer months. Kudlikila will often happen out in the tundra, however not too far from the city. Many tents will be set up, including the largest one which will hold the two partners. Tents will be formed in a semi-circle formation, with the largest one in the center. Elders and Shamans will be the closest, then people of high standing and family members, and after them being friends, and after them would be friends from other clans and nations. Now, what exactly happens at the Kudlikila is up to the partners and their families, however this is a rough list of events that may happen: Going on a hunt Snapping the neck of a medium sized animal, and having a Shaman look at the organs to predict the longevity of the marriage Singing and dancing A large feast, often mainly consisting of meats Giving gifts to the two partners (Often relating to their profession, such as animal skins to a seamstress, or spears for a warrior) Lighting Kudlik lamps Death Rituals - Death is tricky, to say the very least. It is incredibly hard to penetrate the icy earth to create graves. Only people from high society and social positions can be buried beneath the ice. For these people, caskets will be decorated with purples and blue. Shamans are the only one that can bury and touch the dead, (due to superstition) and will be the main orchestrator of most funerals. However, for the average person, there will be a water burial. This journey is difficult, because the nearest large body of water in Arenqii is far. People will often be set off to sea with something important to them, such as a spear or a piece of jewelry. A shaman will say a few things, perhaps light incense, and the family can say goodbye as the body sinks into the cold. Children - Heavily influenced by their Northern heritage, the Arenqii hold firm traditions and beliefs in child upbringing. The age-old saying \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d can\u2019t be more relevant, as the tribe is very community oriented and often relies on neighbors for support. Most children are trained along a certain path from the start and most families try to have at least 2 children. Twins - like Twi and La, twins are considered two halves to one whole; yin and yang; a spirit broken in two. Therefore, twins are brought up in a unique path where many activities, rites, and ceremonies require the children to be together. Triplets + - when a spirit is split a third time at birth, this is very dangerous. Although rare, triplets are seen as evil and weak spirited, susceptible to possession by dark spirits. In Northern traditions, often the smallest of the triplets would be sacrificed to save the souls of the other two. This is not practiced anymore - at least not knowingly or publically. Yuk Rites of Passage - To become a fully-realized adult and citizen of the tribe (and the city) young men and women must complete 2 rites; first, either the Long Hunt or the Unity Trade, then the Spirit Walk: The Long Hunt - usually for boys; the boy will spend 4 weeks in the wild, living with the game of his choosing (usually seals). When this time has ended, he will challenge the largest or alpha beast and bring it home for feast The Unity Trade - usually for girls; elder daughters are traded between two families for 4-6 weeks as a way of \u201cuniting\u201d the two families and bringing the community closer together. The daughters become the caretakers for their adopted parents, grandparents, and siblings until the time has passed. The Spirit Walk - a 1-4 day journey where a teen is to get in touch with themself, discover his/her calling, and obtain an appreciation for nature. All Arenqii complete this rite as the final step to becoming a Yuk. After a certain level of maturity, the teen will walk into the wilderness and stay for 1-4 days with no food or sleep, pushing at starvation and sleep deprivation to the point of hallucination. It is said that these hallucinations reveal the individual\u2019s \u201cspirit animal\u201d which will guide them for their lives and help set out a path toward Lingo \ud83d\udd17 Arenqiirturtet - committee/community Arenqii - \u201cpeople of the community\u201d Katurrvik - gathering place; community hall Uquq - the oil from arctic seal and whale-walrus blubber/fat; has a variety of uses, but especially used in Kudlik lamps Yuk - tribes(wo)man; citizen of Amaruq City Kenruk - friend; or an outsider who is close to the tribe Yagtuk - outcast; someone who has willingly or forcibly left the community Ila - Family, thought often times used as \u2018found\u2019 family and not blood relations Written by Konasi/Mantha & Wang","title":"Arenqii"},{"location":"nations/water/arenqii-clan/#the-arenqii-of-amaruq","text":"\u27f0 \u201cIt takes a village\u2026\u201d \u27f0 The Arenqii are one of the youngest tribes in the south, made up of several distinct kinships and families.

Overview of the Clan System \ud83d\udd17 The Southern Water Tribe has a clan system where each village/settlement is ruled by a clan leader/Chieftain. The leader\u2019s role is to lead their clan both IRP and OOC. They are responsible for communicating the clan\u2019s needs with the Chief and protecting their clan. The leader of a clan will produce roleplay for their clan however it is not solely their responsibility. Anyone can plan and host roleplay events. Although clan leaders rule their clans, they and the members of their clan are still subject to the Chief and laws of the Southern Water Tribe. OOC the Clan Leaders are voted for by the playerbase and IRP each clan has its own method of choosing their leader. The requirements listed below are general requirements . Please note that individual clans may have additional requirements relating to roleplay and clan lore. You can click on any of the clan names below to find out how that clan chooses their leader as well as lots of other useful information about the clan. List of Clans \ud83d\udd17 There are 5 clans, all of them are located in the Southern Water Tribe: Town/Village Clan Clan Leader Title Amaruq Arenqii Lawspeaker Nauruk Heagga Chieftain Eskele Koalkoaq Chieftain Angnikuyaak Angniku Elder Shaman Sukika Yutu Chieftain Requirements for running \ud83d\udd17 You must be a water tribe citizen. You must be a member of the clan you are running for at the time of the election. Your character must live in the village of the clan they are running for (you do not physically have to own a house on the server but IRP you must live there) . Your character must have existed actively for 8 weeks prior to running for the position. (Based on discord poll, 70% voted for 8 weeks minimum activity) . The minimum age to run for leader of a clan is 20 however this may vary depending on the clan. OOC Elections \ud83d\udd17 Elected clan leaders will maintain their position for 4 months after which time anyone who meets the necessary requirements can challenge them (OOC) to a vote for their position. When a new leader is to be chosen an ooc vote will occur through google forms. Candidates will have the opportunity to make their case for clan leader in a designated discord channel where players can also ask them questions. If no one challenges the current clan leader then no vote will occur and the current leader will maintain their position. Clan leaders will only be removed from their position if they lose an ooc vote or if they are deemed inactive by the Nation Leader (Chief). Voting & Roleplay \ud83d\udd17 OOC voting does not necessarily affect anything IRP. If someone calls for an election after the 4 month period is up and the current clan leader wins then they will retain their position and nothing is affected IRP unless the former and new leader want to include an IRP aspect or if it would be part of the clan\u2019s lore. Example scenario: Contender calls for an ooc election. Current leader wins the election. Option 1: Nothing is affected IRP and the clan leader retains their position as normal.

They are the most spiritual out of all clans and have the most Shamans and healers. They used to be the Capital of the Southern water tribe but that has not been the case anymore for many years. Due to them being the closest to the closed spirit portal makes their environment the most suitable to grow herbs and flora in the tribe. Social Norms \ud83d\udd17 Nauruk/Heagga clan is rather conservative and traditional. But unlike most, if not all clans the females are higher up. They are the head of the house holds where as men live under. Outside the houses men usually live freely and do more for fun than work unlike the women do. When a woman and man marry they move into the females family home and carry the females name. And not the males. Reindeer Herding \ud83d\udd17 Heagga clan people often herd reindeer when able to, they used to have a low population. But recently it has began to grow again. Attire \ud83d\udd17 Unlike the other clan\u2019s furs and mostly blue attire, the Heagga clan looks very different. Due to their spirituality and heavy belief in spirits, they have slowly developed their own very distinctive style. They call their ceremonial robes and clothing Gakti. They have red threads and patterns sewn into them and often have gold accessories. The shapes vary between people. Married and single people have different patterns, shamans and others have different patterns, chieftains have different patterns and the list goes on. The colours in gakti are blue, yellow, red, brown and green usually. People of Heagga do not wear makeup or warpaint, other than the 14-year-old boy\u2019s paint after they have passed their rite for manhood. Just like the clothing the hair is important also, being colonized by the Fire nation for many years they have adapted to a few thing they did. You could tell by not only the cloths which rank, or profession the person had. But also how they styled their hair and which accessories they used. Rituals \ud83d\udd17 Duodji \ud83d\udd17 It is a sacred special craft made in ritualistic means to make knives, gakti, beds etc. Men use wood of a sacred tree that is only chopped down for this ritual. Bones and antlers are used as well, the men has to keep raise a Yak reindeer and then offer it to the spirits. Only then they can use these items. Unlike the men, women use leather and roots to make clothing and other tools. Yoiking \ud83d\udd17 Yoik is the special ritualistic way of singing in the Heagga clan. It is a hymn-like way of singing. Shamans often yoik while performing rituals. For every ritual there is a different style of Yoik. The people also sing Yoik\u2019s when big feasts are held or just as a every day activity. Passing/Birthing \ud83d\udd17 When someone passes away the clan comes together. The shamans chant a Yoik while the Chieftain prepares the body to go from the human world to the Spirits world. When a baby is born they bring it to the eldershams igloo. They hand him or her over while the Elders perform a ritual. Once they are done blessing the child with their gifts they hand them back to the parents. Bending \ud83d\udd17 Military \ud83d\udd17 Due to them being the old capital they have a bigger military station than most. But now that they aren\u2019t it has reduced and have now less military men and women. The heagga clan does provide most healers for the army. Even though the military is one, the Heagga warriors wear signs of their tribe to show respect to the spirits. Fighting Style \ud83d\udd17 The warriors of Nauruk/Heagga do not believe in taking ones life without reason, they will try to be more on the defensive side rather than offensive. Though when hunting they will try to take the animals life swiftly and painless ending with a thanking ritual. Healing \ud83d\udd17 Healers and shamans make out the most population. They have some of the best healers. Transport & Trade \ud83d\udd17 Transport - They use a lot of Reindeer Yak\u2019s. Riding on them, making them pull sleds etc etc. On seas they use ships either made from their wood, or just a boat that the entire tribe uses. Trade - Because they have the most flora of the tribes they provide most medical herbs that is no where else grown. They also provide wood and other substances such as Yak\u2019s. Hierarchy \ud83d\udd17 Chieftains - Rulers of Heagga and Nauruk as a whole. Often respected shamans or otherwise spiritual people. Take advice from their council and Elders. Chieftain - Retired Chieftains and respected elderly people of the clan. Have no authority but are to be respected. Shamanic Council members - Shamans who are a part of the Chieftain\u2019s small council of advisors. Shamans - Spiritual healers, leaders and guiders. Warriors - People who fight for Heagga. Mothers & Grandmothers - The people who raised the people. Men and Other Women Children - Younglings must respect their elderly. Outsiders - They are welcome as long as they follow the rules and do not disrespect their ways.

Written by Toots & NoodlePoodle","title":"Hierarchy"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/","text":"The Koalkoaq of Eskele \ud83d\udd17 The Koalkoaq Clan resides in the town of Eskele which is built on cliffs by the coast. These cliffs are rich in minerals such as steel, iron and bronze and the waters off the coast are hotspots for sea creatures such as whales to pass through on their annual migrations. The combination of these things allows the Clan to acquire the materials needed to make superior weapons and armor. As a coastal and militant town, Eskele is known for its shipbuilders and weaponsmiths. At age 8, boys and girls are assessed on their aptitude for qualities such as bloodthirst, strength, speed and leadership. These factors are judged and the elders decide which ones are fit to go on to become warriors and which ones aren\u2019t. Those who fail have jobs such as miners, healers, hunters, caregivers and shipbuilders. Boys and girls who are deemed so unfit that they don\u2019t even qualify for non-warrior careers are cast from the highest cliffs of Eskele and left for dead. Those who are deemed fit to become warriors complete a rite of passage to earn their Koaqi Warrior title. They are pit against each other in a dueling ritual, during which the young ones dress in traditional armour and use a spear with a dull blade. The only way to become a Koaqi warrior is by winning the duel which ends in either death or submission. Those who submit do not go on to become warriors and instead have non warrior jobs within the clan. The survivor or winner of the duel becomes a Koalkoaq/Koaqi Cub and completes 6 years of warrior training before becoming a fully fledged Koaqi Warrior at age 14. At this stage they get their first tattoos. Chieftaincy \ud83d\udd17 When a new Chieftain is to be chosen, all those who would like to try and become Chieftain gather on the cliffs on what is known as Challenging Day. Challenging Day occurs on the eve of the Blue Moon, this event is known as Kanik (About once every 2 years). The challengers each approach the Chieftain 1 on 1 and a series of battles occur. Each battle ends by death or submission. Participants who submit are respected for their bravery and efforts and remain in the clan. The last Koalkoaqi standing is crowned Chieftain. As Chieftain, they are not only the leader of the warriors but also leader of the clan. Any member of the clan can approach the Chieftain on challenging day however it is rare for non warriors to do so and so the Chieftain usually ends up being a warrior rather than someone with a non warrior job. The more experienced a warrior is the more chance they have at winning the duel and so the older warriors with years of training usually become Chieftain. To run for Chieftain of the Koaqi you must; Meet the requirements outlined here. Be a member of the clan, either by birth or through the Ikaik. Live in Eskele (you do not have to physically own a house in Eskele on the server but irp you must live there) Challenging Day \ud83d\udd17 The Koalkoaq clan has a Challenging Day IRP every 2 years. If someone wants to challenge the current Chieftain at this event an ooc vote will be held and then the event will be roleplayed and the winner of the ooc vote will win the duel. However you do not have to wait for Challenging Day in order to challenge the Koaqi Chieftain, the 4 month system still applies (as outlined on the Clan Election post) however Challenging Day will occur IRP regardless. Example scenario: After the 4 month term a contender calls for an ooc vote, however the next Challenging Day isn\u2019t for another 4 months (1 IRP year). The vote will still happen and if the current Chieftain loses then an IRP reason will be made as to why there is a new Chieftain (see above and below spoiler), however that reason will not be Challenging Day as they are at set times. 4 months later it is Challenging Day. The event must still be roleplayed whether or not an ooc vote is called. The current Chieftain could fight an NPC or throwaway if no one has challenged them ooc or an actual contender irp. Clan Roles \ud83d\udd17 Koaqi Warrior - The most valued and respected members of the clan. These warriors are aged between 14 - 60 and are tasked with enforcing the clan\u2019s rules and protecting the clan\u2019s land, people and property. The Koaqi warriors consist of benders and non benders but most often a warrior is well versed in both. A fully trained and experienced Koaqi Warrior is able to use their weapon in conjunction with their bending as well as each separately. Elders & former Chieftains - Elders include retired warriors and members of other professions, as well as former Chieftains. They are looked to for their knowledge and experience and look after the clan. Shipbuilder - Shipbuilders are experts in their craft. They build, maintain and repair Eskele\u2019s fleet of ships. Smith - Smiths work to craft weapons, armour, tools and other items from the metal gathered by the miners. Miner - Miners work to extract natural resources such as metal from the cliffs and rocks of Eskele. These are then refined and used to make weapons, armour and tools. Hunter - While most Koaqi Warriors make capable hunters, there are specialists. These are responsible for hunting animals around Eskele. The hunters kill, clean and separate the parts of the animal to be used for food, pelts, decoration and jewellery. Healers - Eskele is known for its healing springs and boasts a number of expert healers. The Koaqi have their own healers which use the springs but can only heal members of the clan. Fishermen - Eskele's fishermen are experts at hunting the fish and animals found off the coast. Eskele's primary food sources all come from the sea and so their fishermen are very important. Koaqi Culture \ud83d\udd17 Greetings - The most common greeting is a forearm shake or headbutt which are used for all situations, both formal and informal. With close friends, partners, or those they trust, a Koaqi may greet another by holding the back of the person's head and pressing their foreheads against each other. Koaqi warriors sometimes form blood pacts with those in their \u2018platoons\u2019 to solidify their bond. Clothing - The Warriors usually wear a pseudo-armor when not in battle, usually along with spoils of past battles won. This manifests as jewelry, forearm gauntlets and in some cases necklaces made from bones and body parts. Transport - The Koaqi are all trained to sail and use it as their main method of transport as they can transport heavy goods and they know the southern waters well. They also use sleds with a combination of wolves and bending for land transport, usually only when sledding would make the journey quicker than sailing. Tattoos - The warriors have a long tradition of tattooing themselves. The process is long and painful and even letting out a gasp during the process is considered a sign of weakness. The more battles you\u2019ve won and the higher your rank within the tribe, the more tattoos you are allowed to have. Elders of the clan can be seen with almost 80% of their body tattooed. War paint - Before going into battle, they perform rituals where they paint their faces as an intimidation tactic. Fighting Style - The Koaqi bending style is not like traditional rhythmic and flowing waterbending, it is rather rigid and often resembles earthbending in terms of aggression, power and stance. The Koaqi are fond of using more brute force such as ice spikes and sharp \u2018whip\u2019 like techniques. This serves their ruthless nature better as when fighting, it is usually to kill or severely subdue the opponent. Healing - Koalkoaqis who are healers may only heal other Koalkoaqis and members of the clan may only receive healing from Koalkoaqi healers. Healers who aren\u2019t part of the clan can heal anyone else. Relationships in the clan - While the Koaqi reside in Eskele there are also non clan members who live there. Being a Koalkoaqi is taken very seriously and they are at the top of the social hierarchy. They live in the best homes and are given preferential treatment. It is seen as taboo for warriors to marry and have children with non-warriors. It is seen as taboo for a Koalkoaqi to marry and have children with the underclass, those who are not part of the clan. It could result in both being banished from the Clan and having their title as a Koalkoaqi taken away. Birth - When a baby is born within the clan everyone gathers for a ritual where the baby is painted in warrior colours and dipped in a bath of water from the sea. This is said to make the baby strong in hopes that they will become a Koaqi warrior. The elders and parents help to decide on a name for the child after this ritual. Death - When a member of the clan dies their body is burned and sent to the spirits. When a high ranking member of the clan dies, they are placed on a decorated ship surrounded by gifts in the form of weapons, armour and kills from the clanspeople. The ship is set on fire and sent out to sea. Normal members of the clan are placed on decorated wood piles on the highest cliffs of eskele and burned. The Koaqi celebrate the clan member with days of chants, feasts, duels and hunts in their honour. Adoption - Children are highly valued in the clan as they have the potential to become Koaqi Warriors so it is rare that they would be given up by their parents. If a child\u2019s parent(s) die then the elders of the clan will take on the role of raising them. They will still be assessed at age 8 and trained by the other warriors in the clan if they pass. The Ikaik \ud83d\udd17 How outsiders become Koalkoaq \ud83d\udd17 The Koalkoaqi believe in the Koalkoaqi Spirit and recognize that people born outside of the Clan can be born with it. If an outsider wishes to prove themselves deserving of the title, they must journey to Eskele and pass the Ikaik. In order to be considered, outsiders must be deemed worthy by the Chieftain and by the Elders to prove that they have the Koalkoaq spirit. If deemed worthy they will be accepted into the clan and assigned a master/mentor to train them and help them prepare for the Ikaik, a long and challenging series of trials. Koalkoaqis who lose a loved one/one of their pupils in a trial don\u2019t hold a grudge against the victor, they are respected as the winner as it is part of Koaqi tradition. Those who pass the Ikaik are considered fully fledged Koalkoaqis and are treated no differently from those born in Eskele. Outsiders may be matched with either a Koalkoaq born or another outsider seeking to pass the Ikaik in their trial by combat. A Koaqi who is facing punishment of banishment or death may be subject to duel the outsider in their Ikaik in a bid to keep their life and position in the clan. The Ikaik Trial \ud83d\udd17 The initiates begin the Ikaik with minimal clothing, often shirtless with only light trousers, footwear, their weapon of choice and spikes to climb the cliffs The first part of the trial is the clan\u2019s version of ice dodging through the rough rocks and waters around Eskele After completing the ice dodging course the initiate must swim from the ship to the base of the cliffs The initiate must climb to the top of one of the cliffs (each initiate\u2019s mentor stands at the top of the cliff waiting to oversee the remainder of the challenge should their student make it up) Those who make it to the top have until nightfall to hunt for food and pelts They are then buried in snow by their mentor and left for 24 hours The next night, the initiate can dig themselves out of the snow and they have until dawn to thaw, hunt, eat, gather pelts, make a fire and mentally prepare for the final challenge the following day. They may not return to the village during this time. On the third day all surviving initiates return to the village and are paired up for the final duel. Koalkoaqis who lose a loved one/one of their pupils in this duel don\u2019t hold a grudge against the victor, they are respected as the winner. Those who win their duel become fully fledged Koaqi warriors When a new group of Koaqi warriors are welcomed into the tribe, the celebrations can last for up to a week, this includes the day after the duel where the new warriors receive their first Koaqi tattoos. Animals \ud83d\udd17 Found in Eskele\u2019s lands and waters: Otter penguin \u2502 Penguin with four flippers used for sledding Whale-walrus \u2502 Creature whose blubber is used to make lamp oil Arctic seal \u2502 Swimming mammal native to the South Pole Polar orca \u2502 Hunted for its meat in the Southern waters Cuttlefish \u2502 Used to make paint that is applied for ceremonial markings Fish \u2502 Various species are typically relied on for food in the Water Tribe Wolf \u2502 Canine that inhabits the polar regions of the Earth, including the North and South Poles Written by Lego/Taio & Oren/Maniitok","title":"Koalkoaq"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#the-koalkoaq-of-eskele","text":"The Koalkoaq Clan resides in the town of Eskele which is built on cliffs by the coast.

Example scenario: After the 4 month term a contender calls for an ooc vote, however the next Challenging Day isn\u2019t for another 4 months (1 IRP year). The vote will still happen and if the current Chieftain loses then an IRP reason will be made as to why there is a new Chieftain (see above and below spoiler), however that reason will not be Challenging Day as they are at set times. 4 months later it is Challenging Day. The event must still be roleplayed whether or not an ooc vote is called. The current Chieftain could fight an NPC or throwaway if no one has challenged them ooc or an actual contender irp.","title":"Challenging Day"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#clan-roles","text":"Koaqi Warrior - The most valued and respected members of the clan. These warriors are aged between 14 - 60 and are tasked with enforcing the clan\u2019s rules and protecting the clan\u2019s land, people and property. The Koaqi warriors consist of benders and non benders but most often a warrior is well versed in both. A fully trained and experienced Koaqi Warrior is able to use their weapon in conjunction with their bending as well as each separately. Elders & former Chieftains - Elders include retired warriors and members of other professions, as well as former Chieftains. They are looked to for their knowledge and experience and look after the clan. Shipbuilder - Shipbuilders are experts in their craft. They build, maintain and repair Eskele\u2019s fleet of ships. Smith - Smiths work to craft weapons, armour, tools and other items from the metal gathered by the miners. Miner - Miners work to extract natural resources such as metal from the cliffs and rocks of Eskele. These are then refined and used to make weapons, armour and tools. Hunter - While most Koaqi Warriors make capable hunters, there are specialists. These are responsible for hunting animals around Eskele. The hunters kill, clean and separate the parts of the animal to be used for food, pelts, decoration and jewellery. Healers - Eskele is known for its healing springs and boasts a number of expert healers. The Koaqi have their own healers which use the springs but can only heal members of the clan. Fishermen - Eskele's fishermen are experts at hunting the fish and animals found off the coast. Eskele's primary food sources all come from the sea and so their fishermen are very important.","title":"Clan Roles"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#koaqi-culture","text":"Greetings - The most common greeting is a forearm shake or headbutt which are used for all situations, both formal and informal. With close friends, partners, or those they trust, a Koaqi may greet another by holding the back of the person's head and pressing their foreheads against each other. Koaqi warriors sometimes form blood pacts with those in their \u2018platoons\u2019 to solidify their bond. Clothing - The Warriors usually wear a pseudo-armor when not in battle, usually along with spoils of past battles won. This manifests as jewelry, forearm gauntlets and in some cases necklaces made from bones and body parts. Transport - The Koaqi are all trained to sail and use it as their main method of transport as they can transport heavy goods and they know the southern waters well. They also use sleds with a combination of wolves and bending for land transport, usually only when sledding would make the journey quicker than sailing. Tattoos - The warriors have a long tradition of tattooing themselves. The process is long and painful and even letting out a gasp during the process is considered a sign of weakness. The more battles you\u2019ve won and the higher your rank within the tribe, the more tattoos you are allowed to have. Elders of the clan can be seen with almost 80% of their body tattooed. War paint - Before going into battle, they perform rituals where they paint their faces as an intimidation tactic. Fighting Style - The Koaqi bending style is not like traditional rhythmic and flowing waterbending, it is rather rigid and often resembles earthbending in terms of aggression, power and stance. The Koaqi are fond of using more brute force such as ice spikes and sharp \u2018whip\u2019 like techniques. This serves their ruthless nature better as when fighting, it is usually to kill or severely subdue the opponent. Healing - Koalkoaqis who are healers may only heal other Koalkoaqis and members of the clan may only receive healing from Koalkoaqi healers. Healers who aren\u2019t part of the clan can heal anyone else. Relationships in the clan - While the Koaqi reside in Eskele there are also non clan members who live there. Being a Koalkoaqi is taken very seriously and they are at the top of the social hierarchy. They live in the best homes and are given preferential treatment. It is seen as taboo for warriors to marry and have children with non-warriors. It is seen as taboo for a Koalkoaqi to marry and have children with the underclass, those who are not part of the clan. It could result in both being banished from the Clan and having their title as a Koalkoaqi taken away. Birth - When a baby is born within the clan everyone gathers for a ritual where the baby is painted in warrior colours and dipped in a bath of water from the sea. This is said to make the baby strong in hopes that they will become a Koaqi warrior. The elders and parents help to decide on a name for the child after this ritual. Death - When a member of the clan dies their body is burned and sent to the spirits. When a high ranking member of the clan dies, they are placed on a decorated ship surrounded by gifts in the form of weapons, armour and kills from the clanspeople. The ship is set on fire and sent out to sea. Normal members of the clan are placed on decorated wood piles on the highest cliffs of eskele and burned. The Koaqi celebrate the clan member with days of chants, feasts, duels and hunts in their honour. Adoption - Children are highly valued in the clan as they have the potential to become Koaqi Warriors so it is rare that they would be given up by their parents. If a child\u2019s parent(s) die then the elders of the clan will take on the role of raising them. They will still be assessed at age 8 and trained by the other warriors in the clan if they pass.","title":"Koaqi Culture"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#the-ikaik","text":"","title":"The Ikaik"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#how-outsiders-become-koalkoaq","text":"The Koalkoaqi believe in the Koalkoaqi Spirit and recognize that people born outside of the Clan can be born with it. If an outsider wishes to prove themselves deserving of the title, they must journey to Eskele and pass the Ikaik. In order to be considered, outsiders must be deemed worthy by the Chieftain and by the Elders to prove that they have the Koalkoaq spirit. If deemed worthy they will be accepted into the clan and assigned a master/mentor to train them and help them prepare for the Ikaik, a long and challenging series of trials. Koalkoaqis who lose a loved one/one of their pupils in a trial don\u2019t hold a grudge against the victor, they are respected as the winner as it is part of Koaqi tradition. Those who pass the Ikaik are considered fully fledged Koalkoaqis and are treated no differently from those born in Eskele. Outsiders may be matched with either a Koalkoaq born or another outsider seeking to pass the Ikaik in their trial by combat. A Koaqi who is facing punishment of banishment or death may be subject to duel the outsider in their Ikaik in a bid to keep their life and position in the clan.","title":"How outsiders become Koalkoaq"},{"location":"nations/water/koalkoaq-clan/#the-ikaik-trial","text":"The initiates begin the Ikaik with minimal clothing, often shirtless with only light trousers, footwear, their weapon of choice and spikes to climb the cliffs The first part of the trial is the clan\u2019s version of ice dodging through the rough rocks and waters around Eskele After completing the ice dodging course the initiate must swim from the ship to the base of the cliffs The initiate must climb to the top of one of the cliffs (each initiate\u2019s mentor stands at the top of the cliff waiting to oversee the remainder of the challenge should their student make it up) Those who make it to the top have until nightfall to hunt for food and pelts They are then buried in snow by their mentor and left for 24 hours The next night, the initiate can dig themselves out of the snow and they have until dawn to thaw, hunt, eat, gather pelts, make a fire and mentally prepare for the final challenge the following day. They may not return to the village during this time. On the third day all surviving initiates return to the village and are paired up for the final duel. Koalkoaqis who lose a loved one/one of their pupils in this duel don\u2019t hold a grudge against the victor, they are respected as the winner.

These climates are usually covered in snow and ice but are perfectly livable to its habitants. Some Waterbenders can also live in a settlement within the Earth Kingdom that consists of mostly swamplands called the Foggy Swamp. For the most part, the separated tribes, North, South, and Foggy, don't really interact with each other due to their distance. Distance isn't the only thing separating each tribe as each of them share different cultural norms among themselves. In most cases, people of the Water Tribe are peaceful, though not to be mistaken for weak. The dominant season for the Water Tribe is the winter. This means that more Waterbeners are born in the winter than any other season. Water Tribe culture is, as the name states, that of a tribal setting and primarily lead with a strong military. This is especially true after all three tribes served in the ending of the hundred-year war. Aside from their militant structure, the Water Tribe is actually a very spiritually rich culture, especially since the portals leading to the spirit world are located at the North and South pole. Present \ud83d\udd17 After a period of tension threatened war between the North and South, former Southern Chief Kilaa took over power in the North after defeating Valqu, the Northern Chief who threatened the stability, safety and rights of those in both the Northern and Southern Tribes. With Kilaa managing the aftermath in the North, a new Southern Chief, Chief Kaya came into power. Government \ud83d\udd17 The Northern and Southern Water Tribes are governed under a Chiefdom system. Under a Chiefdom, political and economic power is exercised by a single person over many communities. In the Southern Water Tribe there are five Clans spread out across the continent, each with their own elected clan leader to lead them. The clan leaders sit on a council with the Southern Chief who is the overall ruler of the South. They help and advise the Chief in all aspects of Southern life. In the Northern Water Tribe the Northern Chief is in charge of the entire Tribe and has a council of advisors. The Northern and Southern Tribes operate separately and are not dependent on each other. Government System: Chiefdom Head of State: Chief Head of Government: Chieftain Council Territorial Divisions: Clan regions Heads of Territorial Divisions: Clan leaders Capital: Amaruq City Culture \ud83d\udd17 The Northern Water Tribe \ud83d\udd17 The Northern tribe is led by its chief who currently is Chieftess Akna. This is particularly strange due to the tribes' known patriarchal views. It wasn't until 100AG that women of the tribe were permitted to even learn Waterbending outside of healing. Women are also at marrying age when they turn sixteen. At this age, they are proposed to by men with a hand-carved betrothal necklace that is to be worn as a display of engagement. This is completely organized by the parents as free love is not practiced. The Southern Water Tribe \ud83d\udd17 Though very similar in terms of what they way and common practices, the south is not as oppressive as their northern sister tribe. The Southern Water Tribe is lead by its chief who is currently Chief Kaito. The Southern Tribe is much smaller yet practices a lot more freedom for its people. Men and women of the Southern Water Tribe are allowed to learn waterbending as well as marry freely as they please. A rite of passage for members of the southern tribe is held at the age of fourteen, where the children are expected to navigate a ship through a river of large chunks of ice. Each child earns a mark of honor for passing: The Mark of the Brave, the Mark of the Wise, and the Mark of the Trusted. Both tribes often wear blue to represent the element of their nation along with animal furs for warmth. Their fashion still represents a slightly tribal form, but both tribes still have differences in the type of things they wear. Typically the members of the tribe will have darker skin, brown hair, and blue eyes. The names of their citizens will typically include one or two uses of the letter 'K' or 'Q' with \"ah\" sounds in them. The Foggy Swamp Tribe \ud83d\udd17 The Foggy Swamp Tribe is very different from the others. They don't typically look the same as the other two in terms of physical appearance as well as clothing. The clothes they wear are giant leaves fashioned into basic covers for their private areas and their heads. Not much is known yet about the Foggy Swamp Tribe, however. History \ud83d\udd17 During the era of Raava, the ancestors of today's Water Tribe had received their bending from the Lion Turtle they had inhabited. They would request the ability whenever they were set out to leave their home and venture into the Spirit Wilds for food. After the Lion Turtles had left their roles of protectors of mankind, these ancestors had created their first few settlements in the North Pole. These settlements grew into becoming one large city that was later broken apart due to discourse that leads to several members traveling to the South Pole to create their own tribe. Since the split, each tribe has kept some similar cultural aspects the same, but have developed many differences. Hundred Year War \ud83d\udd17 The hundred year war affected each tribe in different ways. Each tribe did take part in the downfall of the Fire Lord Ozai, but the effects of one hundred years of the Fire Nations aggressions did cause lasting damage that even to this day have yet to be restored. The Southern Tribe was reduced to a small spec on the entire South Pole due to the Fire Nations constant raids. The Northern Tribe broke out into political warfare among themselves having lost the Princess and nearly losing the Moon Spirit during the assault led by Admiral Zhao. The Northern Chief Arnook took it upon himself to lead some members of his tribe down to their sisters in the south and help repair what was lost in the war and to rebuild the bond between both tribes. Despite his best efforts, the elder chieftains of the north didn't agree with Arnook. The elders actually saw this as a time to remove the northern tribe from any more worldly affairs as they saw the damage and trauma it had caused for their home and their people. The Chief would not change his mind and neither would the elders which lead to civil war breaking out. Instead of watching his home be torn apart over a senseless war Chief Arnook respectfully stepped down from his title and left to the south along with several other members of the tribe. The closest relative and eldest of the chieftains was appointed Chief in his place. Chief Tarkik believed that the North would be able to sustain themselves as they had for the last hundred years, and maintaining that with more isolation would bring them more success. Communication from the rest of the world, including the southern tribe, stopped over time and the Northern Water Tribe became a completely isolationist nation. With more wars waging on between the other nations and their sister tribe, they even began to raise their surrounding walls twice as high and continuing to mind their own business. It wasn't until the death of Chief Tarkik that the new Chieftess Akna, his daughter, decided to venture out of the ice that anyone was seen from the north in a long time. The Southern Tribe began to repair itself slowly over time. Resources were slim for many, many years and the citizens lived in tiny huts or tents. With the Northern crew arriving and settling in the tribe began to become somewhat self-sufficient again. For reasons still unknown, in the year 106AG, the south was attacked by malevolent spirits that took the lives of many including the Chief. Kaito was appointed chief at this time and with his wife passing in the attack he cared for his people and his daughter by himself for years onward. After the second war with the Fire Nation in 120AG and losing his daughter the Chief fell into a long depression for about two years. The tribe suffered losses of the war and the Chief mourning for so long, but after two years had managed to rebuild themselves into a better tribe that mimics the design of the north and continues to rebuild to this day.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"nations/water/water-tribe/#the-water-tribe-lore","text":"The Water Tribe is a name used to describe the Nation of Waterbenders and Nonbenders living in the North and South pole.

Their history has been lost since the eradication of the Waterbenders during the 100 Years War. They lost tradition and relied on others to build the Southern Water Tribe back to its former glory. But now things have changed and thank Tui and La that the elders had kept records of the old way. They are a tribe of fierce hunters who become one with the hunt. They connect to the animal and see themselves as the apex predators but with the knowledge that anything can change during the hunt. Children are taught at a young age that even with bending or a weapon the hunt is not merciful to all. The villagers of Sukika and the Yutu work together and when children reach the age of 10 they are able to choose if they want to join the Yutu or not. Once they choose to join the Yutu, they prepare for the two main tests of the Hunt. They get to choose their weapon, no matter if they are benders, then they have to learn to make it. First with traditional materials and then in the wild with whatever they have around them. Once they have mastered their weapon, then they pass the first test and they then learn the basics of the others. They learn every way to hunt, and even some fighting. But they only know basic self-defense. This is the second test. Learning how to take down each animal, and the best ways to do so. As well as tracking and stealth. The pups will also spar with the newly initiated Nanuk\u2019s. The pack mentality is taught with intense emphasis because together is the safest and the lone wolf will always be lost. They finish the trial at age 16 where they have to venture out into the wild with their pack for a week. Each member must bring home a kill, but what happens on that hunt is forever secret and sealed by blood (the blood oath is done with the Chieftain) to solidify the bond of the pack. Traditions and Titles \ud83d\udd17 Titles \ud83d\udd17 Pup: Children under 16 or those who have not completed the tests as adults Foundling: Anyone that wants to become part of the yutu and is from outside sukika Nanuuk: Members who passed the tests Marruuk: the chieftains second-in-command Professions/Statuses \ud83d\udd17 Hunter: Every single member of the clan that isn't a pup or an elder is one and are expected to contribute to the well being of the clan Shaman: The clans doctor looks after the clans sick and wounded Sentry: Guards that watch out for anything that may be of danger to the clan. Mentor: Senior members of the clan who are well experienced hunters, they're in charge of guiding the pups Elder: The old folk of the clan who are too old to hunt. they still help the clan but do light stuff Trader: Members of the clan that travel the tribe to trade with the other clans Warriors: Though they\u2019re not with many, these clan members have received extra combat training to make them excel at fighting most of them are sentries and watch over the clan. Smith: These members take care of the clans weapons and equipment and are most of the time mentors who help the pups craft their first weapons. Fisherman: Hunters like the rest of the clan only specialized in aquatic animals. Wolfbreeder: The yutu have a strong connection with wolves as they use them as sentries and hunting partners therefore a few members of the clan breed them since it's easier to train the pups. Medicine: While there are benders there is an extreme focus on finding ways to heal or patch yourself up in the wild, since there aren\u2019t many healers among the Yutu. Greeting: Hands formed into a claw are placed over the heart in formal settings, in more casual settings it's the clasping of forearms. And for those who are most trusted and loved they clasped forearms to bring the two people close with their arms crossed and foreheads touching. Becoming part of the Yutu: Those born to the Yutu have a choice to join or stay a villager. For outsiders anyone who is able to pass all the tests and has the heart of a hunter can become part of the clan. Warpaint: For ceremonies they use a striped pattern over the face and arms, and some men choose to hunt without a shirt then the lines are moved down their chest with a wolf print in the center of their chest. For simple hunts they have learned to make patterns with paint to help them blend into the wilderness for the hunt. The paint is white to help with the darkness of their skin in the snow. Clothing: Very typical for Water Tribe, used to the extreme cold and tend to wear less coverings than other villages, but nothing too extreme. Mainly sleeveless tunics, or tops with normal trousers and fur lined boots. They also typically are wearing leathers and furs around their waists. The furs are big enough to be able to wrap around their shoulders if needed. Hunters always make something out of their first kill ( example: an arm band out of the skin of a seal or a cloak from a bear pelt.) Relationships in the clan \ud83d\udd17 The Yutu have a pack mentality and heavily care about the clan as a whole. Individual packs are like best friend groups, not all the packs get along but they all trust that they will keep each other safe on the hunts. It is thought that the Clan is valued on the strength of their weakest member/pack, meaning that they all must work together to keep the strength of the clan alive. Marrying a Yutu does not make you a Yutu, you still must pass the tests but you do not not have to become a Yutu to marry one. If you are dating or marrying a non-Yutu you can decide to follow the Yutu traditions or not. Courting: When looking to court someone, it is very simple. You just ask them to join you on a simple solo hunt. Engagement: This is a slightly more complicated tradition: Whoever in the couple decides to ask must do the following. They must go to a the closest relative of the same sex of their partner and ask them to come one a hunt (so if a man is asking then he must take her sister out on the hunt). This is to show that they will be able to take care of them in their \u2018new\u2019 family. The relative is able to accept or deny but that is mainly an old tradition. Then whoever is asking must make a weapon and piece of jewelry for their partner, from that hunt. Then if they accept the proposal they will wear the jewelry and they will use the weapon on their hunt for their wedding. (Either gender can ask, it is not expected of any gender to always be the gender to ask. So a woman can ask a man or vice versa.) Same sex relationships are not hated or forbidden in this clan, but they are not common or easily accepted. Wedding tradition: A wedding is typically a proclamation of the couples love in front of the clan, with the Chieftain or a clan elder (aka Gran). There isn\u2019t a massive spiritual aspect other than a simple blessing. Once this is done, the couple will take the weapon made from the engagement hunt and go alone to hunt. What they hunt will be based on their skill, if they are traditional hunters, they will go for a leopard, but if they are mainly fishermen or smiths they will go for a simple elk. This hunt is thought to be the couples honeymoon, and can last a few days. Chieftaincy \ud83d\udd17 To decide a new Chieftain, a mighty and fast creature, typically a wolf or bear, is marked. Whoever succeeds in catching and killing the creature is named the new Chieftain. The creature is picked at the beginning of each Litter of new Pups. Animals \ud83d\udd17 Arctic camel: A thick furred, two humped animal from the Southern Water Tribe used for transportation. Polar bear: Non-hybridized arctic creature native to the Southern Water Tribe, Most known for their sheer strength and intelligence. Killing one is seen as a great achievement and a complement to one's skill in hunting. They\u2019re very rare Polar-bear-dog: A large, four-legged wild carnivore; it was historically feared and hunted by the Water Tribe but can be tamed. Once tamed its use is mostly as a mount or pet Polar Leopard: White leopard that preys on turtle seals. Hunted for their pelts which are used for clothing. Typically reserved for ceremonies or special events. Such as weddings, political meetings, births ,etc. Turtle seal: Brown seal with a hard shell, Favorite snack of the polar leopard. Hunted mostly for their meat, blubber and shell. Remains are often used as bait for predators. Yak: Large, four-legged herbivore. Hunted for their pelts and meat, If not hunted kept for their milk. Wolf: Canine. Sometimes called the \u201cYutu\u2019s best friend\u201d due to the similarity between them, they\u2019re mostly used as hunting partners or sentries Special equipment \ud83d\udd17 Jaikak \ud83d\udd17 A special cloak that is used for hunting to make the wearer go up in his arctic surroundings. It's made from snow white pelts that cover the entire length of the wearer\u2019s back including the legs. Usage: the wearer is supposed to lay down on their belly into the snow and make themselves as flat as possible. The Jaikak will make it incredibly hard for them to be spotted with the naked eye. when the animal they\u2019re hunting is near the wearer can jump up and ambush their prey Ulu \ud83d\udd17 All-purpose knife used for skinning and cleaning animals, weapon and trimming blocks of snow and ice (igloo building). It\u2019s mostly made out of a large round shaped blade made from stone or metal with a handle made from a bone or tusk. Signals \ud83d\udd17 Horn Blasts \ud83d\udd17 The Yutu use Horns to make announcements to the clan for example to indicate a snowstorm is coming. The horn blasts are taught to every member from a young age and is something every member of the clan is expected to know the meaning of. 1 blast: Gather near the Town Hall 2 Blasts: Snow storm Incoming 3 Blasts: Attack Incoming 1 short blast before 1 long: Celebration 1 long low blast: Mourning Written by Searc & Wild","title":"Yutu"},{"location":"nations/water/yutu-clan/#the-yutu-of-sukika","text":"The Yutu clan is the clan that resides in the small village of Sukika. Their history has been lost since the eradication of the Waterbenders during the 100 Years War. They lost tradition and relied on others to build the Southern Water Tribe back to its former glory. But now things have changed and thank Tui and La that the elders had kept records of the old way. They are a tribe of fierce hunters who become one with the hunt. They connect to the animal and see themselves as the apex predators but with the knowledge that anything can change during the hunt. Children are taught at a young age that even with bending or a weapon the hunt is not merciful to all. The villagers of Sukika and the Yutu work together and when children reach the age of 10 they are able to choose if they want to join the Yutu or not. Once they choose to join the Yutu, they prepare for the two main tests of the Hunt. They get to choose their weapon, no matter if they are benders, then they have to learn to make it. First with traditional materials and then in the wild with whatever they have around them. Once they have mastered their weapon, then they pass the first test and they then learn the basics of the others. They learn every way to hunt, and even some fighting. But they only know basic self-defense. This is the second test. Learning how to take down each animal, and the best ways to do so. As well as tracking and stealth. The pups will also spar with the newly initiated Nanuk\u2019s. The pack mentality is taught with intense emphasis because together is the safest and the lone wolf will always be lost. They finish the trial at age 16 where they have to venture out into the wild with their pack for a week. Each member must bring home a kill, but what happens on that hunt is forever secret and sealed by blood (the blood oath is done with the Chieftain) to solidify the bond of the pack.","title":"The Yutu of Sukika"},{"location":"nations/water/yutu-clan/#traditions-and-titles","text":"","title":"Traditions and Titles"},{"location":"nations/water/yutu-clan/#titles","text":"Pup: Children under 16 or those who have not completed the tests as adults Foundling: Anyone that wants to become part of the yutu and is from outside sukika Nanuuk: Members who passed the tests Marruuk: the chieftains second-in-command","title":"Titles"},{"location":"nations/water/yutu-clan/#professionsstatuses","text":"Hunter: Every single member of the clan that isn't a pup or an elder is one and are expected to contribute to the well being of the clan Shaman: The clans doctor looks after the clans sick and wounded Sentry: Guards that watch out for anything that may be of danger to the clan.

Here's a walkthrough on how to use it to set up a character and speak as them! (You don't have to use this bot when roleplaying on discord, it's completely optional ). Creating a Character \ud83d\udd17 The bot uses rp! as its prefix for every command. To create a new character you go to the designated 'Bot-Commands' channel and type: rp!create followed with your character's name. For example: If I wanted to make a character named 'Roleplay Tutorial' I would type the command, rp!create Roleplay Tutorial . Character Profile Customisation \ud83d\udd17 Now that you've set-up a character with your desired name it's time for you to begin personalising it! Type rp!cmds profile to see a list with all the commands related to character profiles. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on fully personalising your character's profile: Whenever you make edits you need to select the character you want. You can do this by typing rp!select and then type the number of your character (the bot will show you which number your character is). Now we can add the information to the profile. (All the following options are optional and don't have to be added.) Age - To set your character's age you need to type, rp!age followed by your character's age. For example: If my character was 25 I would type, rp!age 25 . Gender - To set your character's gender you need to type, rp!gender followed by your character's gender. For example: If my character was non-binary I would type, rp!gender Non-Binary Sexuality - To set your character's sexuality you need to type, rp!sexuality followed by your character's sexuality. For example: If my character was undetermined about their sexuality I would type, rp!sexuality Undetermined Description - To set a character description you need to type, rp!desc followed by your character's description. For example: If my character was a roleplay tutorial bot I would type, rp!desc I am roleplay, here to assist you!

You can do this by typing, rp!colour followed with a hex code . For example: If I wanted to make a red colour strip I would type, rp!colour #FF0000 . Prefix - This is necessary if you want to be able to speak as your character on the discord channels. You type your prefix before your message for it to speak as your character. For example: If I wanted to type 'rpR' before all my messages to make it speak as my character I would type, rp!prefix rpR . Now if I type rpR \"Hello!

As a beginner it can seem confusing and hard to understand, so we made this guide to help you learn and become a capable roleplayer! At the end of this you should be able to understand roleplay terminology , how to act out combat roleplay with dice rolls and more ! Character Terms \ud83d\udd17 Roleplayer - The 'roleplayer' is the person at the keyboard playing the character. OOC - This stands for 'Out of Character'. This refers to anything that is happening out of roleplay, such as something the roleplayer is saying not as a character. OC - This stands for 'Original Character'. Your OC is the character you have created to roleplay as. IRP - This stands for 'In Roleplay'. This refers to anything that is happening in roleplay as characters. It is the opposite of OOC. Throwaway - Throwaways are small characters that are often made for interesting backgrounds or situations where a specific role is needed. Sometimes another player might need a doctor for one of their roleplays so you could always play a 'throwaway' character who will be there for this situation and then not be played afterwards, some people have recurring throwaways who only appear in situations they're needed in and aren't played elsewhere. It's important to make sure throwaways are realistic to prevent any powergaming or metagaming. (These terms will be explained below.) Roleplay Terms \ud83d\udd17 Powergaming - This is a term used to describe a situation where one person's character is controlling another player's character without their permission. This is not allowed because you are only allowed control your own character Example of Powergaming 'My character threw a rock at your head and killed you' - This would be powergaming because you just killed someone's character without giving them any chance to do anything, such as dodge the attack and have a chance to survive. Situations which result in some sort of control over another person's character must be agreed by the roleplayers involved. Metagaming - This is a term used when someone has their character know things that the character did not find out in roleplay. This is not allowed as it can be used to ruin other players' storylines and general immersion and is essentially roleplay cheating. Example of Metagaming The Fire Lord has died and it's been kept in secret so the Fire Nation doesn't go into mass panic. I know this information out of character and go tell other characters about it in roleplay without my actual character finding out about the death. - This would be metagaming as my character doesn't know the Fire Lord has died so even though I know about it out of character I can't have my roleplay character know this knowledge without actually finding it out in roleplay. Godmodding - This term is used for characters who have unrealistic powers and skills they didn't work for. This is not allowed because you have to work through roleplay to achieve rare abilities or master something. You can find the information about how to do this for each nation on their mastery pages. It is important that characters work for their skills and still have flaws. Example of Godmodding My character is a master firebender who knows combustion bending and how to lightning bend. He also is really good at telling when people are lying so it's impossible for people to plot against him. - This would be Godmodding because the character is a master and knows extremely complex and rare skills which they haven't worked for which gives them an extreme advantage over others. Mary Sue - This is a term for a character who has no flaws at all and is absolutely perfect. This is not allowed on our server because we want to keep roleplay realistic and fair so having a character without flaws wouldn't abide by that. Example of Mary Sue My character is the smartest man in the world who also knows bloodbending and mastered waterbending at the age of 5. If anyone makes him slightly threatened they will get killed instantly. - This would be a 'Mary Sue' character as they have no flaws at all. It's important that characters are kept realistic and aren't perfect by having certain flaws to them. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you think someone is doing one of these things make sure to let them know so you guys can discuss it and explain what things might need to be changed to fit these criterias. If you are confused about any of these terms you can always ask other roleplayers. Roleplay Speech \ud83d\udd17 Please make sure you are using the right channel for roleplaying when doing it in-game or on discord. If you are roleplaying in-game do roleplay in /ch roleplay so people know you are roleplaying. If you are roleplaying on discord make sure you carefully select with nation discord you'll be roleplaying in and in which channel you'll speak in to avoid confusion. Speaking in Character - It's important you make your in character speech obvious so that people don't think you're speaking out of character. We ask you to use roleplay chat channels and it's advised to use speech marks when your character is speaking. For example: \"Hello!\" He said as he waved. Performing Actions in Character - When doing actions as your character it's important to differentiate it from speech to avoid confusion, there are two ways to do this. You can use * 's before and after the actions or just not use speech marks to show you aren't speaking. For example: *I bowed to the King.* \"Hello, sir.\" or I bowed to the king. \"Hello, sir.\" Speaking Out of Character - When in a roleplay scenario you need to make it clear when you're speaking out of character. You can do this by speaking in local channel rather than the roleplay channel by doing /ch local . You can also use brackets around the words you are saying out of character. For example: I put some dirt in his sandwich. ((This is going to be so funny! Combat Roleplay \ud83d\udd17 Combat Roleplay is something people find themselves in a lot. It's a really fun way to have your character get through fights and learn combat without it being unfair. Acting out combat roleplay can be confusing at the start but this should teach you exactly how to do it. It's important you don't break the rules on godmodding and powergaming as that would completely ruin the fairness of combat roleplay. This means whenever you are doing combat roleplay and haven't got permission to directly kill or badly hurt someone you leave room for them to react, so instead of going 'I hit and pierce you with a really sharp ice spike.' you would say 'I lift a sharp ice spike and attempt to hit you in the shoulder with it' this leaves room for the other person to evade, dodge and react in any way they want, no matter how strong your character is you are never allowed to powergame without the other player's permission. Sometimes this can lead to combat roleplay lasting a very long time if both players are keen on not letting their character get hurt which is why some people prefer to use rolls. Rolls \ud83d\udd17 Rolls aren't required when roleplaying so it's important to discuss with the other person if you will be using them or not. Rolls can be done in all our Nation's discords so it's important to ask what command that nation uses for dice rolls. We do rolls out of 20 , so you'll get a random number between 1 and 20 with the lower the number the worse the action is. If someone rolled a 20 when throwing a boulder and you rolled a 3 for your defence their boulder would hit you as they had a significantly higher roll. Some people don't like to use rolls as they find their combat roleplays are more interesting and realistic when they do it themselves, it's important to note that if you don't use rolls your character should still take a few hits here and there even if they're a master .","title":"Roleplay Guide"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-guide/#guide-to-roleplay","text":"Roleplay is another way for players to experience our server and get immersed in the world we have built.

This refers to anything that is happening in roleplay as characters. It is the opposite of OOC. Throwaway - Throwaways are small characters that are often made for interesting backgrounds or situations where a specific role is needed. Sometimes another player might need a doctor for one of their roleplays so you could always play a 'throwaway' character who will be there for this situation and then not be played afterwards, some people have recurring throwaways who only appear in situations they're needed in and aren't played elsewhere. It's important to make sure throwaways are realistic to prevent any powergaming or metagaming. (These terms will be explained below.)","title":"Character Terms"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-guide/#roleplay-terms","text":"Powergaming - This is a term used to describe a situation where one person's character is controlling another player's character without their permission. This is not allowed because you are only allowed control your own character Example of Powergaming 'My character threw a rock at your head and killed you' - This would be powergaming because you just killed someone's character without giving them any chance to do anything, such as dodge the attack and have a chance to survive. Situations which result in some sort of control over another person's character must be agreed by the roleplayers involved. Metagaming - This is a term used when someone has their character know things that the character did not find out in roleplay. This is not allowed as it can be used to ruin other players' storylines and general immersion and is essentially roleplay cheating. Example of Metagaming The Fire Lord has died and it's been kept in secret so the Fire Nation doesn't go into mass panic. I know this information out of character and go tell other characters about it in roleplay without my actual character finding out about the death. - This would be metagaming as my character doesn't know the Fire Lord has died so even though I know about it out of character I can't have my roleplay character know this knowledge without actually finding it out in roleplay. Godmodding - This term is used for characters who have unrealistic powers and skills they didn't work for. This is not allowed because you have to work through roleplay to achieve rare abilities or master something. You can find the information about how to do this for each nation on their mastery pages. It is important that characters work for their skills and still have flaws. Example of Godmodding My character is a master firebender who knows combustion bending and how to lightning bend. He also is really good at telling when people are lying so it's impossible for people to plot against him. - This would be Godmodding because the character is a master and knows extremely complex and rare skills which they haven't worked for which gives them an extreme advantage over others. Mary Sue - This is a term for a character who has no flaws at all and is absolutely perfect. This is not allowed on our server because we want to keep roleplay realistic and fair so having a character without flaws wouldn't abide by that. Example of Mary Sue My character is the smartest man in the world who also knows bloodbending and mastered waterbending at the age of 5. If anyone makes him slightly threatened they will get killed instantly. - This would be a 'Mary Sue' character as they have no flaws at all. It's important that characters are kept realistic and aren't perfect by having certain flaws to them. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you think someone is doing one of these things make sure to let them know so you guys can discuss it and explain what things might need to be changed to fit these criterias. If you are confused about any of these terms you can always ask other roleplayers.","title":"Roleplay Terms"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-guide/#roleplay-speech","text":"Please make sure you are using the right channel for roleplaying when doing it in-game or on discord. If you are roleplaying in-game do roleplay in /ch roleplay so people know you are roleplaying. If you are roleplaying on discord make sure you carefully select with nation discord you'll be roleplaying in and in which channel you'll speak in to avoid confusion. Speaking in Character - It's important you make your in character speech obvious so that people don't think you're speaking out of character. We ask you to use roleplay chat channels and it's advised to use speech marks when your character is speaking. For example: \"Hello!\" He said as he waved. Performing Actions in Character - When doing actions as your character it's important to differentiate it from speech to avoid confusion, there are two ways to do this. You can use * 's before and after the actions or just not use speech marks to show you aren't speaking. For example: *I bowed to the King.* \"Hello, sir.\" or I bowed to the king. \"Hello, sir.\" Speaking Out of Character - When in a roleplay scenario you need to make it clear when you're speaking out of character. You can do this by speaking in local channel rather than the roleplay channel by doing /ch local . You can also use brackets around the words you are saying out of character. For example: I put some dirt in his sandwich. ((This is going to be so funny!","title":"Roleplay Speech"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-guide/#combat-roleplay","text":"Combat Roleplay is something people find themselves in a lot. It's a really fun way to have your character get through fights and learn combat without it being unfair. Acting out combat roleplay can be confusing at the start but this should teach you exactly how to do it. It's important you don't break the rules on godmodding and powergaming as that would completely ruin the fairness of combat roleplay. This means whenever you are doing combat roleplay and haven't got permission to directly kill or badly hurt someone you leave room for them to react, so instead of going 'I hit and pierce you with a really sharp ice spike.' you would say 'I lift a sharp ice spike and attempt to hit you in the shoulder with it' this leaves room for the other person to evade, dodge and react in any way they want, no matter how strong your character is you are never allowed to powergame without the other player's permission. Sometimes this can lead to combat roleplay lasting a very long time if both players are keen on not letting their character get hurt which is why some people prefer to use rolls.","title":"Combat Roleplay"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-guide/#rolls","text":"Rolls aren't required when roleplaying so it's important to discuss with the other person if you will be using them or not. Rolls can be done in all our Nation's discords so it's important to ask what command that nation uses for dice rolls. We do rolls out of 20 , so you'll get a random number between 1 and 20 with the lower the number the worse the action is. If someone rolled a 20 when throwing a boulder and you rolled a 3 for your defence their boulder would hit you as they had a significantly higher roll. Some people don't like to use rolls as they find their combat roleplays are more interesting and realistic when they do it themselves, it's important to note that if you don't use rolls your character should still take a few hits here and there even if they're a master .","title":"Rolls"},{"location":"roleplay/roleplay-rules/","text":"Roleplay Rules \ud83d\udd17 Our server has rules on roleplaying to make sure that it is done fairly for everyone. If these rules are broken it can result in a situation having to be non-canon or voided.

No God-Modding - Your character can't have op abilities such as bloodbending without working for it through our system. No Mary-Sue Characters - Your character can't be perfect and have no flaws. To keep characters realistic they should have flaws and not be overly powerful without training. No Arguing ( OOC ) - We ask that you don't argue over roleplay out of character, if there's a disagreement over something like someone else god-modding it's important to remain mature and provide reasons and examples instead of arguing. If the disagreement persists contact the relevant nation leader as they are experienced roleplayers who will be able to help. In some situations staff may get involved. No Powergaming - You aren't allowed to control someone else's character without the player's consent. This includes things like really hurting them or killing them. Use the Roleplay chat channel - We have a roleplay channel where roleplay should be done to make it clear what you're saying is in roleplay and not cause confusion.

Names should try and fit with Avatar lore - We ask you to try and have character names fit with our server and Avatar lore. There are some useful name generators out there to help you! Use roleplay speech - Make actions and speech clear in your roleplay messages by using things like speech marks. Other player's consent is necessary - If you are roleplaying something with another player you must make sure that they have agreed to what will happen (eg. killing them) and that they are comfortable with the situation.

Argueing in Roleplay is allowed, but if you disagree with someone due to something done in Roleplay, don't argue about it. Power-playing is not allowed Please explain when you are Roleplaying or not. If you RP outside of your role or skillset it will be voided. You can not wake up one day being a master bender. You must work for it. Please use Roleplay chat for roleplaying. Keep in mind that Roleplay chat has a radius of 75 blocks! When roleplaying please use proper roleplay etiquette. This means putting \u201c \u201c quotations before and after speaking text, and * asterisks when doing an action or no symbols at all. This way your intentions are clear to others. Example: Ras turned his head towards the bandit. He equipped his dagger and charged towards the criminal.* \u201cHey you, stop!\u201d. We highly recommend you create a character introduction. Do not create a character application right away. Character applications are only used when you are trying to make your character have huge roleplay rank goals. This character that receives an accepted application should be your main character. When it comes to role play families, you are only allowed to play one character per family. You may not create more characters to join a family for the intention of having more family members. When you roleplay a character with disabilities and mental health conditions please be respectful about it. You must research these disabilities before you attempt to roleplay a character with them (EX: PTSD, Bipolar personality disorder, DID, ect.) Please refrain from using stereotypes of some disabilities/communities. For example, do not use Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) as a villain because you think this disease is bad. It's important to have a player's consent when Roleplaying. Each nation has their own roleplay-dedicated Discord.

If you are asked to stop attacking them, you stop. Additional Gameplay Rules Housing & Shops You are allowed to have two houses and one shop on your main account. We allow for two houses on a players main account because not everyone can afford multiple accounts. These players use their one account for multiple characters, and may want to have their homes for their other characters. Your alternate account(s) may only have one house and no shops, you can only have one shop per person, not account. You are free to be creative and to decorate the inside of your house and shop however you want (as long as it's appropriate). Changing the style or block of the exterior is not allowed with the exception of minor changes such as window types and placing flowers, pots, or banners. For bigger changes please contact a staff member first. We love to see you display your cards collection proudly on the walls on item frames, but please don't place more than 30 entities (item frames, paintings, armorstands, etc) inside your house or shop as entities on large scale can cause server lag. Estates are allowed to have up to MAX 40 entities. Do not turn homes into shops and shops into homes. You are allowed a shope and a home property, so this should not be an issue. If your properties run out of rent the region will be reverted to its original form. All blocks, chests, and items will disappear. Rokucraft is not responsible for the possible losses of your stuff if your rent expired. We will try to refund your items up to a point, as long as proof can be provided. We may however not be able to refund everything, so be mindful with your rent expire dates. Make sure to check out the 'Gameplay' tab if you need help getting started with a shop or a house! Roleplay Roleplaying is one of the main aspects of our community. Please be cautious that roleplay does not equal out of character. If you disagree in roleplay that does not mean to fight about it out of character. We can all get along and enjoy our time OOC (outside of character). Meta-gaming and powergaming are not allowed. God Modding is not allowed. Mary-Sue/Gary-Sue is not allowed. It is not interesting to make your character an orphan and also have them be a prodigy at the age of 3. Let's get original in our stories. Originality makes for fun roleplay situations. Argueing in Roleplay is allowed, but if you disagree with someone due to something done in Roleplay, don't argue about it. Power-playing is not allowed Please explain when you are Roleplaying or not. If you RP outside of your role or skillset it will be voided. You can not wake up one day being a master bender. You must work for it. Please use Roleplay chat for roleplaying. Keep in mind that Roleplay chat has a radius of 75 blocks! When roleplaying please use proper roleplay etiquette. This means putting \u201c \u201c quotations before and after speaking text, and * asterisks when doing an action or no symbols at all. This way your intentions are clear to others. Example: Ras turned his head towards the bandit. He equipped his dagger and charged towards the criminal.* \u201cHey you, stop!\u201d. We highly recommend you create a character introduction. Do not create a character application right away. Character applications are only used when you are trying to make your character have huge roleplay rank goals. This character that receives an accepted application should be your main character. When it comes to role play families, you are only allowed to play one character per family. You may not create more characters to join a family for the intention of having more family members. When you roleplay a character with disabilities and mental health conditions please be respectful about it. You must research these disabilities before you attempt to roleplay a character with them (EX: PTSD, Bipolar personality disorder, DID, ect.) Please refrain from using stereotypes of some disabilities/communities. For example, do not use Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) as a villain because you think this disease is bad. It's important to have a player's consent when Roleplaying. Each nation has their own roleplay-dedicated Discord. You can find an invitation-link under the pinned messages in #roleplay-announcements on Discord. All Rokucraft rules also apply there.
