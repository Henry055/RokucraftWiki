*This page describes the relevant show characters and what happened to them after the finale of Avatar: The Last Airbender.*


## Team Avatar

For a short time after Aang’s death, Katara, Sokka, Suki, Toph, and Momo continued to travel together. But as Zuko was brought home to transition the role of Fire Lord to the rightful heir Seb, each of the other members of Team Avatar eventually went off to fulfill their own responsibilities

## Aang

Aang takes Ozai’s bending, but being frozen in the iceberg takes a toll on his body quicker than it happened in Legend of Korra, which would lead to his eventual death. Upon Aang’s death, Appa was by his side and passed along with him. Momo still flies around the Southern Air Temple, an old but still mischievous, lemur. On a rare occasion, he can be spotted.

She returned to the Water Tribes to become a bending teacher and healer. She still teaches other waterbenders the art of healing.

## Sokka & Suki

They both continued to live their warrior lives for a while. Sokka trained the Southern Water Tribe military and Suki mentored the next the Kyoshi Warriors.
