## What are the Air Guardians

Since the genocide, and near extinction of all airbenders, the Air Collective needed some sort of force to protect them in the case of another attack, hence the creation of the Guardians. The Air Guardians are effectively the Air Collective's military; however, the guardians act strictly as a defensive force. Guardians differ from most other airbenders in distinct ways, primarily, their significant detachment from the spiritual path. Spirituality, although crucial to airbending, requires a very self centered mind set, in the form of detaching one's self from many earthly desires. Since Guardians hold the responsibility of protecting the temples, and thus they must act selflessly. Instead of working towards individual enlightenment, guardians devote themselves to the unequivocally important role of protecting the temples at all costs, including the possibility of individual spiritual enlightenment.
